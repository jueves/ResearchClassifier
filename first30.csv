CN-02270159,"NCT04874116,",Decreasing Cardiovascular Risk for Patients With Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04874116,2021,"Study design and overview: The investigators will conduct this study with 17 teams in 12 clinics that serve low‐income patients: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC's). The goal of the study is to evaluate how well the approach to improving patient outcomes with a blend of communication strategies works in real‐world settings compared to mobile phone texting alone. Each team will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Intervention (Group 1): includes a patient group meeting + a checklist used during each medical visit (together called Office‐GAP) along with text messaging in between visits; the Control (Group 2) includes only the text messages. Randomization: The investigators will recruit 22 diabetes (DM) patients per team. All patients at a particular team will participate in the same group (intervention or control). The investigators chose this approach because it is realistic for providers and patients at a team to follow a similar approach. This also helps the comparison of control and intervention groups to be more accurate because there is less chance of mixing between the two groups. In Michigan, FQHCs have similar numbers and types of providers (internal and family medicine) and nurse practitioners. Methods. Setting: Because the investigators are interested in how well the interventions may address disparities in health outcomes for low‐income and minority patients, they are recruited from FQHCs who serve these populations in Michigan. FQHC patients are mainly below federal poverty levels (92% of participants); 56% are non‐white; 91% are uninsured or covered by Medicaid. Sample: A total of 378 patients, men and women, with Type II diabetes that is not well‐controlled (the standard will be a score for the HbA1c test equal to or higher than 8) will be recruited. In the investigators' pilot studies, 80% of patients who met these criteria agreed to participate. In the pilot, about 10% dropped out before follow‐up at 3 months and a further 3% dropped out before completion. A 20% dropout rate is anticipated. Recruiting 378 patients will result in 320 patients retained by the end of the 5 year study. Based on the pilot study and feedback from clinics, it is estimated that the enrollment goal will be reached within 4 years. Each FQHC will have at least 200 DM patients who meet the criteria. Patient Intervention procedures: Patients will participate either in the intervention group (Office‐GAP + Texting) or in the control group (Texting only) as described below. All patients will receive medical treatment‐as‐usual from the participating clinics, consisting of diabetes care, usual preventive care, and other medical treatment as needed. Office‐GAP Intervention (Patient Activation Intervention): The investigators have described the Office‐GAP intervention in previous peer‐reviewed publications (1‐3). Briefly, after recruitment, patients in the Office‐GAP group will attend: 1) one scheduled group visit, (90‐120 min; 4‐6 patients at a time); 2) one follow‐up visit with their providers within one month, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the group visit. At these follow‐up visits, providers will complete the Office‐GAP Checklist, which evaluates medication prescribing behavior. In addition, shared decision‐making (SDM) and goal setting occurs between patient and provider. These follow‐up visits are patients' regularly scheduled visits with their providers and not additional to their usual care. At the group visit: Research Assistants will obtain informed consent/HIPAA authorization from patients after introducing them to the study; Group 1: Office‐GAP + Texting session: the group visit is a Shared Decision Making (SDM) activation session wherein patients learn self‐management behaviors, communication skills, and use of decision support tools (DSTs). They also learn how to use the eCap electronic pill container to monitor medication adherence; learn to use Way to Health Texting service and confirm set up on their mobile phone. Group 2: For the texting only group: participants will learn how to use Way to Health Texting service and confirm set up on their mobile phone, and learn how to use the eCap electronic pill container to monitor medication adherence. They will not experience the Office‐GAP intervention. Both groups will also complete baseline study questionnaires during the group visit. Office‐GAP Follow‐up visit with providers: the Office‐GAP Checklist. The Office‐GAP Checklist is the core tool of the SDM intervention. A one‐page checklist, this SDM tool outlines all evidence‐based medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in T2DM patients. It is an in‐consultation decision support tool that helps engage the patient and provider to encourage and enhance an SDM process via discussion of medication and secondary prevention/lifestyle changes during an office visit. In this study, the Office‐GAP Checklist will be completed by the provider with direct patient involvement during the office visits at 0‐1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Only Group 1 patients will use this checklist during their office visits. The Office‐GAP Checklist also serves as a provider reminder at the point of care, because the provider records a check‐mark for each medication: ""Yes"" (if patient is on the medication), ""No"" (if patient is not), or ""Does not apply to me because…"" A reason for exclusion of a medication is also provided (patient is not eligible for the medication, has a contraindication to its use, or the patient and provider have identified an alternative due to side effect or cost concerns). Details about the next appointment and any secondary prevention plan changes are also listed on the form. At the end of the visit, both patient and provider sign the form to confirm that they have reviewed the checklist. The patient receives a copy of the checklist to take home and a copy is retained in the patient record. All providers in the intervention teams receive a brief provider education in Office‐GAP tool use and communication skills (described below C.4.15). Educational tool literacy standards. Office‐GAP has been rigorously adapted for use with low health literacy patients. All study materials are grade 6 reading level. Mobile DM self‐management texting intervention (Way to Health Texting Program). During group visits, all patients in both groups will be taught how to send and receive text messages on their phone. The Way to Health service does not require patients to use a special app. Way to Health engages patients in two ways: 1) Patients receive daily Way to Health messages appropriate to their diagnosis and medications (e.g. BP, blood glucose, medication) and appointment reminders throughout the study. They also receive informational and educational texts. 2) Patients respond to prompts, and may contact their providers' office throughout the study via texting. Patients will receive additional diabetic modules that follow the standard for diabetes education for the rest of the 12 months once the initial 15 week program is complete. The Way to Health texting program will be used to encourage T2DM patients to maintain communication with their providers, improve medication adherence, and other secondary prevention and self‐care between visits. Daily messages may take the form of reminders, prompts, education, or reinforcement. Sample message texts include ""Did you take your medications today?"" and ""How many times did you check your feet for wounds this week?"" The pilot found the program to be usable and effective for both patients and providers. Provider and Practice Staff Training. All intervention providers will participate in an interactive orientation which has been shown to promote behavioral change among health professionals. Providers will be asked to agree to participate in the study before the session. Provider/Staff Educational module: The training session is 90 minutes long. The session is scheduled at multiple times to meet providers' needs. In the pilot Office‐GAP study, there was 100% participation by providers. The training module, delivered by the PI and Dr. Karen Kelly‐Blake, includes: 1) brief presentations on effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of medical therapy and behavior changes in management of T2DM, blood pressure, and heart disease; 2) a hands‐on practice session for providers to elicit patients' preferences and values; 3) an introduction to the Office‐GAP Checklist and best practices for using it during a patient encounter; 4) review of the Smith evidence‐based patient‐centered method for establishing trust, communicating clearly, and engaging in goal‐setting with patients. Providers will have a chance to practice skills using Braddock and Elwyn's approach to role‐playing to model office visits; and 5) a complete pre‐and post‐training survey (before and after the training session) to determine provider attitudes about the use of DSTs, SDM, and mHealth in their practice and an end of study semi‐structured interview. The investigators are highly experienced in provider training. Analysis of outcomes: The primary outcome (medication adherence ‐ how well patients adhere to their providers' advice to take medications) will be assessed in each individual patient by e‐CAP monitoring, a device that signals when patients open their prescription medication bottles. The investigators will conduct preliminary analysis of study hypotheses at 6mo and 12mo using standard statistical tests. A comparison of Office‐GAP plus Way to Health teams (Group 1) to Way to Health only teams (Group 2) at baseline will be conducted to be sure the patient populations are similar in terms of health characteristics that may influence the results. If substantive differences are found, the investigators will be able to control for these in subsequent analyses using statistical regression techniques. This method assures a degree of dissimilarity rather than assuming all of the clinical populations are identical. Equivalence between the groups will be assessed based on demographic factors such as age, gender, education, race/ethnicity.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04874116,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02270159/full,
CN-01560569,"NCT02990299,",mHealth for Diabetes Adherence Support,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02990299,2016,"Many African‐Americans and Latinos with diabetes do not achieve recommended diabetes goals placing them at high risk for complications. Team‐based models of care can help in reaching goals of therapy. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth) technologies can further improve outcomes among those more difficult to reach. This study will evaluate the impact of a team‐based, mHealth intervention designed to improve medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors. The investigators will compare this mHealth approach with usual care. Clinical pharmacists and health coaches (HC) will deliver our proposed team‐based intervention. mHealth delivery includes mobile phone text messaging, secure videoconferencing, and HC home visits. Pharmacists will focus on medication reconciliation and adherence. Health coaches will help identify psychosocial and environmental challenges to adherence in a culturally‐sensitive manner. Together, they can assist in goal‐setting, problem‐solving, negotiation of competing priorities, and provide social support leveraging mHealth technologies. Preliminary data from previous research by the research team supports the role of health coaches partnering with clinic‐ based pharmacists in improving diabetes outcomes in minorities. In the proposed mHealth intervention, patient‐ pharmacist videoconferencing will eliminate the need for in‐person visits with a pharmacist, which is impractical for many low‐income patients. In addition, pilot work suggests that text messaging is a preferable means of communication and may facilitate more frequent contact with patients. This is a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches. The research team will randomize 220 patients through UI Health to either: (1) mHealth diabetes adherence support through clinical pharmacists and health coaches; or (2) usual care. After one year, patients completing the mHealth intervention will be monitored for an additional year while the usual care group receives the mHealth approach. Outcomes include medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and LDL‐cholesterol levels. The specific aims include: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches to African‐American and Latino adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes; (2) evaluate the maintenance of improved diabetes behaviors as well as clinical outcomes one year after completing the intervention; (3) evaluate the cost and cost‐effectiveness of mHealth diabetes adherence support compared to usual care; and (4) evaluate the reach, adoption, and implementation of mHealth diabetes adherence support based on the RE‐AIM framework.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02990299,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01560569/full,
CN-02269543,"NCT04847778,",Assess the Impact of Insulclock on Glycemic Variability and Treatment Compliance in Uncontrolled DM1 Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04847778,2021,"Study design: This multicentric randomized open‐label study will be conducted at the Hospital General de Segovia (Segovia, Spain), Hospital de Cruces (Bilbao, Spain), Hospital Arquitecto Marcide (Ferrol, A Coruña, Spain) and Hospital Central de Asturias (Oviedo, Spain) after classification by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) and ethical approval by the Ethics Review Committee of each research center. The study will be conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each participant will provide written informed consent before being included in the study. The study is scheduled across seven visits. At Visit 1 (Screening, Week ‐1), demographic and clinical information will be collected, and concomitant medications will be registered. All potential study patients will be screened for eligibility after signing the informed consent form (ICF) and will be assigned with a patient identification number. Laboratory evaluations (HbA1c, serum chemistry) must be available within the last 2 months. An identification number will be assigned to each participant At Visit 2 (Run‐in, week 0), participants will receive information on the use of the Insulclock device and app on masked mode (excluding the use of Insulclock 360 app information and alarms). If the participant does not use a CGM: a healthcare professional applies the FreeStyle Libre sensor to the back of the upper arm and activates it. If the participant already uses a CGM system, the patient will be encouraged to use sensors during this period. At Visit 3 (First Visit CGM 1, week 1) and Visit 4 (Follow‐up, week 3), participants will be encouraged to use the system At Visit 5 (Visit Starting CGM 2 and Randomization, week 4) participants will be randomized (1:1) to the Active Insulclock group or the Masked Insulclock group. Participants randomized in the Insulclock Active Group will receive detailed instructions on using the Insulclock device and Insulclock 360 mobile application and will be instructed and motivated for full use of all system functions (alarms, messages to the caregivers and investigation team). Participants randomized in the Insulclock Masked Group will be instructed on the correct installation and use of the Insulclock system for recording insulin bolus information but they will not receive any other information and will not have access to the Insulclock 360 application from the Internet and will keep administering insulin treatment as before. A healthcare professional will apply a FreeStyle Libre sensor to the upper arm in all the participants who do not use a CGM and will be encouraged to wear the sensor for 2 weeks. Participants who already use a CGM system will be encouraged to use sensors during this period. At Visit 6 (Final Visit CGM 2 and Randomization, week 6). Participants will receive a reminder on the use of Insulclock according to the corresponding group. At Visit 7 (Final Visit, week 7) the mobile application diaries will be collected and reviewed. Participants will receive to fill in the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) and the Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (DTSQ). Study population Investigators will include 80 participants aged 18‐80 years with uncontrolled T1DM who provide written informed consent. Persistent uncontrolled T1DM was defined as HbA1C levels ≥6.5% for at least 1 year, and/or variations ≥1% in HbA1C within the previous 2 years and attending regular (more than 2 per year) follow‐up visits at the Endocrinology department. Investigators will exclude pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with a history of or current alcohol or drug abuse, acute infection, cognitive decline or dementia, or any illness or condition that could interfere with the trial. Study devices: Insulclock is a small electronic device that works as an add‐on module of insulin pens. This device can record the dose and time of insulin injected, register temperature changes of insulin pens, record the duration of an injection, and the specific insulin pen used. In the present study, participants self‐administer insulin with pens coupled to Insulclock and according to routine clinical practice. By means of acoustic and visual alarms, participants receive information for a correct injection technique (an alert if the injection time was <6 seconds) or to prevent stacking insulin (an alert if a previous injection was done within the 2 previous hours). The Insulclock device is synchronized with the Insulclock 360 app for the automatic logging of patient data. The Insulclock 360 app also has a reminder function to promote the timely administration of insulin doses. Users can also receive customized tips on DM management with the ""my tutors"" tool and obtain information on DM topics. Insulclock 360 app is compatible with Apple and Android operating systems. In the Active group, participants will receive acoustic and visual alarms, device‐related information and will have access to the Insulclock 360 app. In the Masked group, participants know the dose, time and duration of injections, but these participants will not receive any reminder and will be masked to the Insulclock 360 app. Participants will use the Freestyle Libre (Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, Oxon, UK) for the continuous monitoring of glucose levels. This flash continuous monitoring system is to be worn on the upper arm and does not require capillary glucose concentrations for calibration. The sensor automatically records glucose data every 15 minutes for 14 days. Statistical Analysis The proposed statistical analysis methods constitute a synthesis of the methods to be used in this study to apply them to the data collected and respond to the general objective and the specific objectives. Data from all participants included in the study, who meet the selection criteria, will be analyzed. Data in absentia will not be charged and will be considered as lost. A general description of the variables included in the study will be made. The absolute and relative frequency distributions of the qualitative variables will be presented by investigators, as well as the measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) of the quantitative variables. The confidence intervals will be presented at 95% for the main quantitative outcome variables associated with the main objective and the main secondary variables. The data corresponding to the variables included in the main objective will be descriptively analyzed. Investigators will use the SPSS software Version 17.0. to perform the analysis. The hypothesis tests that are carried out will be in all bilateral cases and with a significance level of 0.05. For variables that do not fit the normal distribution(or parametric), the Mann Whitney hypothesis tests will be used (for unpaired data). The chi‐square test (or Fischer's exact test when appropriate) will be used for the analysis of contingency tables as well as for the comparison of proportions and/or frequency distributions.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04847778,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02269543/full,

Later, the research assistant will telephone the eligible patients to schedule a first visit to their homes for enrollment. Intervention: The participants randomized to the intervention group will be given a tablet‐based, interactive touch‐screen self‐monitoring system free of charge to perform disease self‐monitoring in their homes. The objectives of the system are to empower patients' ability to self‐monitor and improve their self‐care adherence and medication compliance by enabling access to various e‐support, information, resources, and self‐monitoring tools in a timely manner. It runs on a 10‐inch touch‐screen tablet computer that is programmed to connect to a 2‐in‐1 blood pressure and glucose monitor. Measurement modules are available for assessing and recording blood pressure, pulse, and blood glucose level. The assessment records are fully automated and can be retrieved and reviewed in structured tables and charts. Patients can determine whether assessment values that deviate from the critical levels may need attention based on the ""normal value ranges"" indicated by the system. The system also has a module that provides both text‐ and video‐based learning resources related to the causes and prevention of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, self‐care, salt and sodium intake, diet, action plan (e.g., appropriate actions in response to symptoms), exercise, and stress management. The care information and video capability allow patients to easily learn how to self‐monitor and self‐manage. In addition, the system has a reminder function that can be programmed to emit audible reminders at predetermined times alerting patients to take their prescribed medications. A secured web portal (http://selfcare.imse.hku.hk/) is available for authorized, non‐patient users such as caregivers and families to remotely review and monitor the assessment values of key patient health signs using their own mobile devices or computers. Randomization: Participants will be stratified into four groups based on the HbA1c and systolic blood pressure measurements: (i) HbA1c ≤ 8% and systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg, (ii) HbA1c ≤ 8% and systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, (iii) HbA1c > 8% and systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg, and (iv) HbA1c > 8% and systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg. These cut‐offs for grouping were set based on previous studies (2, 3) and clinical judgement. Within each stratum, the patients will be block‐randomized into the study groups using randomly permuted blocks and sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The randomization and allocation process will be based on the practical guide for permuted blocks randomization in a stratified trial, as described in Doig and Simpson (4), and handled centrally by a researcher in response to a telephone call.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02799953,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Hypertension",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01559001/full,Hypertension

Diabetes distress, a negative response to the diagnosis of T2DM, danger of complications, and self‐management burdens is present in up to 70% of persons with T2DM. Distress is a significant factor in medication nonadherence and poor glycemic control. Treatment adherence is vital to maintain glucose control and reduce complications. The literature has identified dysfunctional thinking patterns such as beliefs (e.g., I can't handle taking these medications), assumptions (e.g., I know I will have side effects to these medications) and interpretations (e.g., I'm too overwhelmed to do all of this stuff) as critical variables that impact both distress and T2DM treatment adherence. Current treatment strategies within primary care do not address the dysfunctional thinking patterns that affect the patient's distress level, T2DM medication adherence, and complex daily self‐care activities. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), a well‐established evidenced‐based treatment, helps patients to identify, and restructure dysfunctional thinking patterns. The investigators propose to test a brief phone CBT approach that is supported by a comprehensive mobile phone CBT skills practice application (app) within primary care. The promising results of the investigators preliminary studies using a mobile phone app to stimulate real‐time CBT skills practice prompt us to propose a pilot of its use with patients with T2DM with the following aims: Primary aim: examine feasibility and acceptability of the assessment protocol, and the recruitment, and retention of study participants. Secondary aim: 1) collect preliminary data on the effect of the intervention on clinical outcomes, e.g., self‐reported adherence to medication and self‐management adherence, e.g., diet, exercise; levels of diabetes distress, diabetes medication beliefs, and distal T2DM outcomes (HbA1c level and body mass index).",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02081586,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01544161/full,

METHODS: Patients with diabetes and depression were randomized to pharmacist‐led or nurse‐led telehealth. Veterans with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, an A1C ≥ 7.5%, diagnosis of depression, and access to a landline phone were invited to participate. Patients were randomized to usual care of nurse‐led telehealth or pharmacist‐led telehealth. Patients were shown how to use the telehealth equipment by the nurse or pharmacist. In the pharmacist‐led group, the patients received an in‐depth medication review in addition to the instruction on the telehealth equipment. RESULTS: After six months, the pharmacist‐led telehealth arm showed significant improvements for cardiovascular medication adherence (14.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 27.6), antidepressant medication adherence (26.0; 95% CI 0.9 to 51.2), and overall medication adherence combined (13.9; 95% CI 6.6 to 21.2) from baseline to six‐month follow‐up. There was a significant difference in A1C between each group at the six‐month follow‐up in the nurse‐led telehealth group (6.9 ± 0.9) as compared to the pharmacist‐led telehealth group (8.8 ± 2.0). There was no significance in the change in patient health questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‐D) from baseline to follow‐up in both groups.

The patients have a two‐fold increased mortality rate compared to the general population T2D is a major problem in Denmark and the incidence is estimated to rise from 280.000 today to approximately 500.000 people by 2020 (5). The T2D rehabilitation program in the Danish municipalities has the overall purpose of introducing and helping patients to a healthier lifestyle (6). The program is conducted in a period of 8‐14 week with some or no exercise intervention, with no long‐term follow‐up. Not much is known on the amount and integration of PA in the patient's everyday life following the intervention (7). This major variation across municipalities poses a problem in the rehabilitation of TD2, as the quality of rehabilitation depends on the geographical location of the T2D patient. Several studies have shown that supervised PA is advantageous; in patients with T2D on key metabolic factors (6‐9) and that it improves quality of life and reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality (1,2,6,10,11,12). Due to the many beneficial effects of PA on T2D patients, PA is an important factor in the prevention and treatment of T2D (13). Long‐term PA interventions have employed supervised exercise regimes (14,15) that are effective, but also demanding and expensive. Attempts to increase the daily physical activity level on a large scale, in a free‐living ""real life"", have very little effect (14‐16) despite well‐established patient education programs. In general, the exercise adherence is low and dropout rates are high in this group of patients. A large number of patients with T2D experience diminished quality of life, decreased physical functioning, diminished exercise tolerance (17), numerous patients are unmotivated or incapable to change behaviour and the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent in T2D patients (17,18,19). Collectively this could pose important barriers to engagement in exercise and reaching the recommended level of PA (20). The use of Tele‐Health interventions (THI) have the potential to educate and engage patients with T2D in self‐management in the long‐term and the evidence suggests that THI could be effective and feasible in improving clinical outcomes in diabetes care (14,15,22,23). The widespread and increasing use of smartphone applications is opening new ways to improve health and health care delivery. It might be ideal to use THI to increase physical activity and hereby target a large part of the population by simple and inexpensive means. The smartphone has been used as a tool among others to register exercise, diet, weight and plasma glucose levels, but the evidence of using a smartphone as an exercise device is lacking (24). Aim/purpose ‐ (Hypothesis) The primary objective of the study is to investigate if the InterWalk app is more effective in increasing the moderate‐and‐vigorous physical activity level compared to a standard care offer in a sample of T2D patients across 52 weeks. Secondarily, we will investigate to what extend the IW app can reduce sitting time, induce weight loss, improve glycaemic control, increase quality of life, improve cardio‐respiratory fitness and reduce the use of diabetes medication. ‐ Standardized walking test: Every 4th week a SMS will be send to the patient regarding new goal setting. Measurements ‐ Personality Questionnaires The patient will be asked to complete two questionnaire regarding personality, the NEO‐Five Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI) and a Sensation Seeking Scale (SES). The study is important and will contribute to great knowledge about how to implement and thus increase public health in a large and growing cohort of patient´s with T2D. Karstoft et al (2013) examined the feasibility of implementing a free‐living interval walking (IWT) and continuous walking training program in a smaller sample of patients with T2D. IWT was initiated and monitored by a Japanese training device, the JD‐mate (10). The study found remarkable effects on physical fitness level, body composition and glycaemic control and with a compliance rate of more than 85% and a very low dropout level (9). Based on the experiences by Karstoft et al and several pilot testing's in the Danish Diabetes Association (DF), we believe that IWT can be an approach to handle lack of PA in patients with T2D. However the JD‐mate, is expensive (3500 kr.), Japanese instructions, lacks automatic transmission of data and is thus not user‐friendly on a larger scale. It is evident that novel low cost, more sustainable exercise solutions and suitable vehicle are needed and through this, improve quality of life and increase life expectancy in these patients. In 2010 the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) and TrygFondens Centre for Aktiv Sundhed (CFAS), Rigshospitalet, Denmark, developed the InterWalk Application (IW app) to the smartphone to promote IWT on a larger scale. IWT has the potential to increase physical activity in a large group of T2D patients and hopefully improve lifestyle in patients with T2D. However, motivation for lifestyle changes is subjectively driven and individually determined (25‐27). The personal resources and the close environment are key determinants of how challenges are handled in everyday life (28,29). Motivational factors are important for changing physical activity behaviour in patients with T2D, but knowledge on how motivation is maintained for a sustainable active lifestyle is limited. Studies of the effectiveness of employing smartphones as a vehicle to improve physical activity behaviour in everyday life in the long‐term in patients with T2D is therefore needed. The primary hypothesis is to test the hypothesis, that replacing a standard exercise program in the normal municipal standard care with the Interval Walking Training delivered by the IW app, the patient will become more physical active. The secondary and explorative hypothesis is that motivational support will increase the individual long‐term physical activity level in everyday in patients with T2D. Methods Study design The study is a 52‐weeks single‐blinded pragmatic randomized controlled trial, where the participants are allocated into three arms. Two of the arms will receive IWT with or without additional support. The control arm will receive the standard care. The interventions are delivered by the Danish municipalities. A detailed description of the three arms is found below. The study is carried out in a subgroup of the DD2 cohort. Participants, Recruitment and eligibility All patients referred to the promotion centre in the municipalities from January 2015 will be screened for eligibility. The patients will be informed about the study and will be given formalized oral and written material, a consent form and a free post envelope. Upon reception of the consent form by the health professional at the municipality, the patient will be contacted by one of the health professionals assigned to the study and a date for the first visit is arranged. Measurements Smartphone administered walking test: The patients are expected to reach 80‐85% of VO2max during the IW walking test. This will cause some degree of breathlessness. Interval walking training: The IWT will cause some degree of breathlessness in the fast walking interval periods. Anthropometric measurements, sit‐to‐stand test, temperature, questionnaires and motivational initiatives: These methods are not associated with any known risk or other unpleasant. Enrolment is anticipated to take approximately 18 month and begins in January 2015, and is expected to be completed in July 2017. The intervention will take place at the promotion centres in municipalities in Denmark. Sample size considerations The minimum difference of interest (MDI) is 10 minutes per day. After applying Bonferroni adjustment due to multiple comparisons in the three group trial and shared end‐points, a total of 393 participants are needed using an sample SD of 25 minutes per day (30) with an α of 0.017 (two‐tailed) to obtain a statistical power (1‐β) of 80%. Allowing for an attrition rate of 30%, 513 patients (171 in each group) are allocated in the three arms. Allocation, randomization and concealment Patients are randomized using random permuted blocks (2x2x2) and stratified by gender to ensure an equal number of participants in all groups across the allocation period. The allocation sequence is generated through a standardized computer program by an independent researcher not affiliated to the study and is concealed until the study arms are assigned. Randomization of each patient to one of the three groups in the study is done after the baseline tests have been conducted by the health professionals at the promotion centres. The scientific staff is blinded to the allocation. The health professionals at the promotion centre are not blinded to allocation according to control group (1/3) or intervention groups (1/3: IWT and 1/3: IWTsupport). After the intervention period at the promotion centre, the allocation to either control, IWT or IWTsupport is unsealed to the patients and the health professionals at the promotion centres. The scientific staff is still blinded. Interventions Group 1 (control group): Patients in this group will receive the standard rehabilitation program with the overall purpose of lifestyle changing in T2D patients in a multimodal setting in the municipality including physical activity. In addition to exercise, the rehabilitation consists of education, smoking cessation and dietary change with the purpose of weight loss, motivation groups and self‐care. The duration of the rehabilitation differs between municipalities with duration from 8 to 14 weeks. There will be no follow‐up from the municipality, which is the normal procedure in the municipality. Group 3 (IWTsuppport) IWT with motivational support after 8‐14 weeks: Patients in this group will like patient´s in intervention group 2 be engaged to IWT with the IW app. The intervention period will be 52 weeks. The first 8‐14 weeks will be conducted together with group 2 with a thorough introduction to the IW app and IWT three times per week for 60 minutes. In addition to the IWT from week 0 to 52, the patients in this group will receive motivational support from week 8‐14 to week 52 by the health professionals at the promotion centre (see below for information regarding the IW app and the motivational support part). The InterWalk Application The IW App is a personal trainer as well as a monitor unit, which allows continuous and automatic transmission of physical activity data to a central data base in DD2. The IW app guides the user in IWT with repeated cycles of 3 minutes fast and slow walking. During IWT the app provides the patients with continuous feedback on the walking intensity (10). The feedback is personalized through a standardized eight‐minute walking test, performed before engaging in IWT. The patients are able to track exercise history and receive historic feedback on the quality of the IWT sessions. The feedback system employs the on‐board accelerometer and GPS system to assess intensity and geographical location. Group 2 (IWT with without motivational support after 8‐14 weeks): Patients in this group will be engaged to IWT with the IW app (see: The InterWalk Application). The intervention period will follow the period in which the rehabilitation program is carried out in the municipality (duration from 8‐14 weeks). The patients are encouraged to perform IWT three times per week, 60 minutes per session. The municipality offers to walk with the patient´s two times per week for 60 minutes per session in group sessions with additional 30 minutes of group discussion afterwards. The last and third time the patients have to walk by themselves for 60 minutes per session. The participating patients will receive a thorough introduction to the IW app and follow‐up during the intervention (8‐14 weeks) from the health professionals. At the end of the intervention period, the health professionals, conducts a transition program, preparing the patients to continue IWT with IW app on their own. There will be no follow‐up from the municipality, which is the normal procedure in the municipality. The patients are obligated to enter their social security (CPR) number before using the app. Uniquely, this will allow the scientific teams to integrate the app into the health care system, link the data with the Danish disease and demographic registers and thus, will enable the study of long term nation‐wide effects of IWT in T2D rehabilitation. The application has been through extensive piloting in different groups of patients with T2D. Information on training intensity, total number of steps per day and IWT‐data and data from the standardized walking test is stored on the smartphone or IPod and automatically transmitted to a central database when connected to Wi‐Fi or mobile data network. Individual motivation (IWTsupport) Motivational support will in addition to the IWT be offered in intervention group 2 after the intervention at the promotion centre. The support is initiated and conducted by the health professionals at the promotion centres. ‐ SMS‐track: The patient i intervention group 2 will receive motivational support which consists of Short Message Service ‐Track (SMS‐Track), phone calls, goal setting and i motivational interviews (see below). The different parts of the motivation intervention will be handled and executed by the health professionals at the promotion centres in the municipalities. ‐ Short Message Service ‐ Track: The first Sunday after enrolment a SMS‐track is send to all patients in either group 2 or 3. The patients will be asked to confirm that they are part of the study, before the next SMS regarding their IWT is send. The patient can receive up to 3 SMS's regarding IWT depending on their answers. ‐ Phone calls: The patient's answers to the SMS‐track, constitute whether a personal phone call from a health professional if necessary. The aim of the call is to help and support the patient in continuing to keep doing IWT with IW app. Questions from the health professionals addresses how the patient is doing in general, why the patient has answered that they haven't been doing IWT the past week, questions regarding how to help the patient doing IWT, or questions about the IW app. The patient will have time to ask questions of concern to the health professional. Individual goal setting: To measure the patients motivation for physical activity using the IW app in group 2 and 3, we ask the patients to set individual goals every 4th week, related to their everyday life, during the intervention period (group 2 (4‐18 weeks) and group 3 (0‐52 weeks) (40) ‐ The goal setting is based on the S.M.A.R.T.‐principle where S stands for Specific, M for Measurable, A for achievable , R for relevant and T for timely (41). ‐ IWTsupport group sessions: Patients in group 3 have the opportunity to participate in IWT with other patient and a InterWalk ambassador at the municipality once a week after the intervention at the promotion centre. Motivational interviews: Four motivational interviews will be scheduled for patients in group 2, in the period where the patient no longer is part of the formalised IWT in the municipality (week 12‐52). The aim of these interviews is to help he patients to maintain motivation and focus tin prioritizing IWT in their everyday life. The interview will take place at the promotion centre. ‐ Level of daily physical activity To evaluate the level of moderate‐to‐vigorous‐intensity physical activity all participants will be equipped with an accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle, UK) for 10 consecutive days, 3 times during the intervention period ‐ at baseline and after 4‐18 weeks and 52 weeks after enrolment. One accelerometer will be placed with patch (Leukomed T, BSN medical, Germany) on the lateral side of the right thigh and one accelerometer on the lumbar spine. The patients will be instructed not to remove the accelerometer during the three periods. The accelerometers can be worn when taking a shower, swimming etc. ‐ Smart‐phone administered standardized walking test The walking test in the IW app consists of 5 stages; 1) 30 sec. of standing still, 2) 2 min. of slow walking 3) 2 min. of walking at moderate intensity 4) 2 min. walking at high intensity 5) 1 min. walking at highest intensity possible. The four later paces are self‐selected. The test is performed with the Smartphone placed at a pocked at the hip and the instructions are communicated auditory through earphones. To ensure the right walking intensity in the intervention period, the patients are asked to perform the test every 4th week. ‐ Sit‐to‐Stand Test The test measures the lower body strength and will be administrated using a chair without arms, with a seat height of 43 cm. The patient is encouraged to complete as many full stands as possible within a 30‐sec time limit (32). Electronic log of data from IWT to the central database Adherence to the intervention is determined by an evaluation of the electronic log of data from IW app to a central database. All the uploaded data can be quantified into adherence. ‐ Physical Activity Questionnaire ""The Resent Physical Activity Questionnaire"" (RPAQ) is a self‐rated physical activity questionnaire. The RPAQ has 9 main questions which covers 4 domains of physical activity: domestic life, work, recreation and transport. Physical Activity is estimated in MET (Metabolic Equivalent) (35). ‐ Short Form ‐12 (SF‐12) The SF‐12 was developed as a short form of the 36‐item Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36). The questionnaire consists of 12 questions and uses a Likert scale of 1 to 3 for the physical function items; 1 to 5 for the bodily pain, social function, and general health perceptions items; 1 to 6 for the vitality and mental health; and a dichotomous scale of yes/no for the presence of role function limitations. The higher score, the higher level of health or functioning (34). ‐ Behavioural exercise regulation questionnaire (BREQ‐2) Behavioural exercise regulation questionnaire (BREQ‐2) measures individual motivation for physical activity. The Questionnaire consists of 19 questions in a 0‐4 Likert format. ‐ Questions on motivation for physical activity for patients with Type 2 Diabetes All patients will be asked to answer four questions in a 0‐4 Likert format, regarding their habits for doing physical activity after being diagnosed with T2D. The NEO‐FFI consists of 60 questions in a 0‐4 Likert format constructed by selecting 2 items from each of the six facets characterizing each of the five personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) assessed by NEO‐PI‐R (36). The Sensation Seeking Scale is a 40 items self‐administered questionnaire and consists of 40 questions designed to test the tendency towards varied, novel and intense sensations (37). The SES‐questionnaire is in its design impertinent as it consists of only two possible response options for each question. The patient will be encouraged to answer the questions, but is not required an answer. We do not know much about what characterizes the individual to either participate or to decline an intervention e.g. diet, smoking cessation or physical activity. The two personality questionnaires are part of the project because it is essential to get more knowledge on personality traits, risk behavior and adherence to an intervention in this case physical activity. By this knowledge it will be possible to better individualize the intervention and by this hopefully get a higher adherence in the long term. ‐ Monitoring of body temperature To detect possible effects of exercise on mitochondrial function a measure of body temperature with an ear thermometer will be performed. Time of measure, season and weather conditions, diseases within the last week and meals before the measure will be noted. ‐ Demographic and social economic Information: Information on demographic will be obtained using standard procedures (height, weight, waist and hip circumference). The demographic data will be obtained from the patient's journal at the Promotion Centre. A tape measure and a weight will be provided to each promotion centre to ensure standardization among health professionals. ‐ Relevant national registers will be used for information regarding co‐morbidities, medical history and use of medicine. All the information from the patient's journal and from relevant registers will be used when all data, from all patients, are collected. The data will be protected by the ""Lov om behandling af personlige oplysninger"" (see 'Protection of personal information', page 12). ‐ Metabolic markers The patients are encouraged to maintain the recommended regular visits every 3th month at the general practitioner (GP) in the intervention period (52 weeks). Results from the visits including the blood sample are collected from the national database DSAM. Risk, side effects, and discomfort General considerations The exercise intervention (Interval Walking Training) is expected as a minimum to be as effective as the standard care programme currently offered to patients with T2D at the municipality. Interval walking Training with the use of a Tele‐Health solution is providing patients with T2D with a feasible option on how to implement and maintain a physical active lifestyle in a gentle and flexible way. The intervention is expected to result in remarkably health benefits on a long‐term basis in terms of improved increased VO2max, blood glucose regulation, and quality of life and motivation for a more active everyday life. AX3 Axivity accelerometers: Due to the patched by which the accelerometers are hold on the thigh and lower bag, itching and redness may occur in allergic subjects. In those cases the subjects are encouraged to remove the patches immediately and if necessary consult a general practitioner. The patients will be informed on procedures in writing containing pictures of the application of accelerometers and possible discomfort. Statistical analysis All analyses will be conducted according to the Intention‐to‐treat principle. Mixed model analyses will be employed to determine the group X treatment effects of the intervention across twelve months. The secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the same approach. Assuming that the data on potential drop‐outs are missing at random multiple imputation procedures will employed to handle missing data. Patterns of missing data will be investigated. Per protocol analyses will be performed to support the primary analysis. Ethical considerations The study is expected to result in limited risks, adverse effects and discomfort to the patients. No invasive methods will be used besides blood samples taken by the GP at regular visits. The patients will benefit from the study in terms of enhanced physical capacity and by introduction to effective training methods. The randomization of the participating patients into three groups is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the InterWalk app. The intervention groups (group 2 and 3) are alike as long as the standard rehabilitation with physical activity proceeds in the municipality. From hereafter only group 3 will be supervised and will receive motivational support from the health professionals. This differentiation between groups is needed in order to obtain insight regarding motivational factors of importance to the individual, to maintain a physical active everyday life. The two personality questionnaires in the study will help to get insight on personality, physical activity and motivation for behavioural changes (e.g. more physical active everyday life). With this knowledge, the results from the study can help the health professionals at the promotion centres, to better allocate patients with T2D, into a rehabilitation offer adjusted to the individual and not as a standard offer in the municipality. Expected outcomes Performing IWT might be a suitable and effective way to exercise for at large group of patients with T2D. The patient can walk everywhere and IWT can hereby be integrated and maintained in the patient's everyday life. Experiences from the study can be used in planning interventions with the IW app and IWT, to patients with other lifestyle diseases e.g. Constructive Obstructive Pulmonary Lung Disease (COPD) and Heart Diseases. The aim is to obtain lifelong physical activity for the individual in their everyday life. Patient insurance The intervention takes place at the promotion centres in the Municipality and the patient is, if anything should happen during the intervention period, insured by 'Patient Forsikringen'. The law says '…personer, der deltager i biomedicinske forsøg m.v., der udføres af private firmaer, foreninger m.v. er omfattet af lovens område, hvis forsøget udføres under direkte ansvar af et sygehus, en statslig højere uddannelsesinstitution m.fl.'. The University of Copenhagen is the 'statslige højere uddannelsesinstitution in this study. Protection of personal information All personal information on the patient's identities are protected by the ""Lov om behandling af personlige oplysninger"". A unique subject ID number will be subscribed to all patients in order to anonymize data. The identification key (ID to personal information) will be encrypted and stored securely and separately from the unique ID number on a secure database. In this way no information on patient´s can be assigned to the ID number. All data is automatically backed up on a secure server. Questionnaires is completed online and automatically uploaded with the ID number to the secure data base. Each promotion centre will be assigned with secured logons to the database and only the health professional assigned to the study, will get logons and will only be able to see the patients included in the study at their promotional centre. The scientific members have access to the secure database and data from all the included patients. All data will be secured in the database and a bag up of all the data is stored in an extern hard disk which is also secured. It is possible to track all logons to the database as well as all tasks done in the database. To enter the IW app the patients are obligated to enter their CPR number, which immediately are encrypted to protect against inappropriate use of the number from unauthorised people not connected to the study. The health professionals in the municipalities will be educated in data entry and will only have access to their own promotion centre. Only the research team will have access to data processing. The IW app is already approved by ""Datatilsynet"" (2008‐58‐0035 (paraplygodkendelse i Region Syddanmark)) and the RCT‐study will in addition be reported to ""Datatilsynet"". Compensation There will be no compensation given to the patient. All participating patients are treated in accordance with the national guidelines regarding rehabilitation in the municipality. Dissemination The data will be published in international peer‐reviewed journals. The results are to be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (38). All results will be disseminated (negative, positive and inconclusive findings). All result will be published (positive, negative and inconclusive).

These significant treatment responsibilities place considerable demands onindividual patients. These demands can lead to high levels of diabetes distress. Diabetesdistress encompasses the emotional distress arising from the constant self‐care burdenthat is required to self‐manage diabetes, but also feelings of insufficient support andunderstanding from others, and challenges in communication with healthcare professionals.Diabetes distress is prevalent among individuals with diabetes. International researchindicates that approximately 20‐25% of individuals with diabetes experience high levelsof diabetes distress. Studies exploring the impact of diabetes distress on diabetesmanagement reveal that significant diabetes distress not only diminishes overallwell‐being but also correlates with suboptimal self‐management of diabetes. This includesinsufficient physical activity, unhealthy dietary choices, reduced medication adherence,infrequent blood glucose monitoring, and elevated HbA1c levels.At Steno Diabetes Center Odense (SDCO), there are provisions for individual psychologicalintervention aimed at patients facing psychological challenges associated with theirdiabetes. However, due to resource constraints, priority is given to those patientsexperiencing the most severe impact.As part of a new initiative at SDCO, Patient‐Reported Outcome (PRO) data has beenincorporated alongside diabetes same‐day micro‐ and macrovascular complication screening,which includes an assessment of mental well‐being (i.e. diabetes distress). Theseassessments will contribute to higher recognition rates of elevated diabetes distress,thereby exacerbating the strain on already limited resources available for individualpsychological intervention. Moreover, not all patients may have the requisite time,necessity, or opportunity to partake in such individual intervention.In order to expand existing psychological services at SDCO in an affordable way, anonline psychological intervention needs to be developed. The objective of the onlinepsychological intervention is to cater to a larger group of people with type 1 diabetes,who can autonomously engage with evidence‐based components of the intervention, therebyaverting the progression of patients' diabetes distress towards adverse or pathologicalconditions, such as anxiety or depression. Studies indicate that therapist‐supportedonline therapy yields comparable efficacy to traditional face‐to‐face therapy.Additionally, online therapy offers the benefit of flexibility, allowing patients toengage with the intervention at their convenience, thereby obviating the need forpatients to take time away from their professional commitments to attend sessions with apsychologist.Aims:The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of anonline intervention with written support for patients with type 1‐diabetes and elevateddiabetes distress, comparing this with an individual intervention by a psychologist(online, phone‐based or face‐to‐face, depending on the preference of the person with type1 diabetes). Following the intervention, qualitative data will be collected throughinterviews conducted with both patients and clinical staff to assess this aim. Alsometadata from the platform of the online intervention will be collected to evaluate thisaim.A secondary aim is to explore the efficacy of the interventions to improve differentdomains of diabetes‐stress. This secondary aim will be evaluated through survey data.Further aims are to explore whether both interventions impact diabetes‐related quality oflife, acceptance of diabetes, patient engagement in healthcare, negative effects of theintervention, useability of the intervention and glucometrics (e.g. estimated HbA1c, timein range (TIR), time above range (TAR), time below range (TBR)).Hypotheses:Primary aim hypotheses: It is hypothesized that both interventions will show highfeasibility and acceptability, demonstrated by acceptable recruitment strategies, highrates of retention and high completion of modules/sessions. It is expected though, thatthe dropout rates will be higher in the online intervention group. It is alsohypothesized that both interventions are acceptable, as demonstrated by satisfactoryfeedback obtained through post‐intervention interviews.Secondary aim hypotheses. It is hypothesized that in both interventions there will be asignificant reduction in participants' diabetes distress from pre‐intervention topost‐intervention, and from pre‐intervention to 3‐months follow‐up.Further, it is also hypothesized that the interventions will yield positive changes indiabetes‐related quality of life, acceptance of diabetes, and patient engagement inhealthcare. It is further hypothesized that the interventions has no negative effect onthe patients, and that the patients find the interventions useful. Glucometrics areincluded as a secondary outcome but as the interventions does not target this, theinvestigators hypothesize no changes in these measures will be found.Recruitment and procedure:Participants for the study will be recruited at Steno Diabetes Center Odense (SDCO) inDenmark. Patients with a total score on the questionnaire Problem Areas in Diabetes(PAID5) of ΓëÑ 8 will receive information about the study. If interested in participating,they can contact the study leader to receive more information about the study andschedule a screening appointment with a study psychologist.During the screening appointment, the patient will have further opportunity to learn moreabout the study and ask questions. If they wish to participate, they will receive aconsent form to sign. Subsequently, the patient will receive a questionnaire including anextended measure of diabetes distress i.e. The Diabetes Distress Scale for type1‐diabetes (DDS‐type1). In the screening appointment, the inclusion and exclusioncriteria will be evaluated. If the psychologist deems the patient suitable forparticipation, the patient will be randomized to either receive an online psychologicalintervention or an individual psychological intervention with 20 patients in each arm.Following the conclusion of the intervention and during the 3‐month follow‐up period,participants will be administered a questionnaire.Subsequent to the feasibility study, semi‐structured interviews will be conducted withapprox. 12 patients, 2‐3 psychologists, and possibly further clinical staff. Theseinterviews will explore aspects related to screening procedures, recruitment strategies,and the acceptance of the online psychological intervention.The online intervention will subsequently be evaluated using a mini Model for Assessmentof Telemedicine (MAST), where the following domains will be assessed: ‐ Health problems and technology characteristics ‐ Patient safety ‐ Clinical effectiveness ‐ Patient assessment ‐ Economic aspects ‐ Organizational aspects ‐ Sociocultural, ethical, and legal aspects.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06436456,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02705927/full,

MOST methodology uses factorial designs and the hypotheses in Aim 1 will be tested through a 2x2 factorial experiment, a highly efficient experimental design despite several common misconceptions about sample size requirements and power. A 2x2 factorial experiment is NOT a 4‐arm trial in which each condition is compared in turn to a control condition. In fact, factorial designs do not require a larger number of participants than other designs (e.g., Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)) and when used to address suitable research questions, they require fewer participants than other designs. Adding factors does not require a dramatic increase in sample size to maintain power.

Our recent trial found that a digital intervention was effective at improving medication adherence in non‐adherent patients with Hypertension or Type 2 Diabetes; but we do not know how it brought about behavioural changes. This research is a post‐trial process evaluation of the mechanism by which the intervention achieved its intended effects. Methods: A mixed methods design with quantitative and qualitative evidence synthesis was employed. Data was generated by two studies. Study 1 used questionnaires to measure the underlying mechanisms of and the medication adherence behaviour, and digital logfiles to objectively capture intervention effects on the process of behaviour change. Multilevel regression analysis on 57 complete intervention group cases tested the effects of the intervention at modifying the mechanism of behaviour change and in turn at improving medication adherence. Study 2 used in depth interviews with a subsample of 20 intervention patients, and eight practise nurses. Thematic analysis provided evidence about the overarching intervention functions and recommendations to improve intervention reach and impact in primary care. Results: Study 1 found that intervention effectiveness was significantly associated with positive changes in the underlying mechanisms of behaviour change (R2 = 0.26, SE = 0.98, P = 0.00); and this effect was heightened twofold when the tailored intervention content and reporting on medication taking (R2 = 0.59, SE = 0.74, P = 0.00) was interested into the regression model. Study 2 suggested that the intervention supported motivation and ability to adherence, although clinically meaningful effects would require very brief medication adherence risk appraisal and signposting to ongoing digitally delivered behavioural support during clinical consultations. Conclusion: This post trial process evaluation used objective methods to capture the intervention effect on the mechanisms of behaviour change to explain intervention effectiveness, and subjective accounts to explore the circumstances under which these effects were achieved. The results of this process evaluation will inform a large scale randomised controlled trial in primary care.",9,,806168,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 34988058,EMBASE 637002350,,,,Journal article,"*behavior change; *hypertension; *medication compliance; *non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; *primary medical care; Adult; Article; Clinical article; Comparative effectiveness; Consultation; Controlled study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy]; Female; Human; Humans; Hypertension; Interview; Male; Medication Adherence; Motivation; Nurse; Primary Health Care; Quantitative analysis; Questionnaire; Randomized controlled trial; Surveys and Questionnaires; Synthesis; Thematic analysis",10.3389/fpubh.2021.806168,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02362090/full,

Attempts to find pharmacologic treatments have been largely unsuccessful, prompting a focus on interventions aimed at modifying risk factors for dementia that occur throughout the life course. In terms of risk factors for dementia, strongest support is for depression, (midlife) hypertension, physical inactivity, DM, (midlife) obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and smoking. The incidence of any dementia was approximately two‐to three‐fold higher in people with than in those without DM, leading to suggestions that interventions addressing lifestyle changes and DM treatment could be beneficial. A number of intervention studies in DM have focused on reduction of cardiovascular outcomes. These results suggest that intensive treatment does not adversely affect patient‐reported outcomes. There have been few cognition studies. Identification of cognitive domains most affected by DM can lead to targeted risk modification, possibly through lifestyle interventions (diet/physical activity) and may reduce risk of cognitive dysfunction and possibly dementia. An overview of cognitive testing in DM showed impairment in tests of executive function, working memory, psychomotor and attentional functions. Impairments of executive function and choice reaction time may have consequences for everyday functioning. Trail Making Task, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Verbal Fluency Task and tests of reaction time and processing speed could be included as core components of test batteries in future intervention studies. However there are few studies with a multifactorial intervention and cognition as an endpoint in DM. FINGER showed that an intensive multi‐domain lifestyle intervention programme (nutrition, exercise, cognitive stimulation and social activity, intensive vascular risk factor control) applied in older people (60‐77 years) at higher risk for dementia produced significant cognitive benefits after 2 years. There are concerns whether the intensive nature of the FINGER intervention are translatable/applicable to clinical practice in different healthcare systems. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of multi‐domain lifestyle interventions in targeted high‐risk populations including a need to develop a practical and feasible program which is deliverable in community settings. A phase 1 qualitative study (REC ref 19/NI/0011) with our target population generated important data to inform the current study protocol. The theoretical domains framework was used to map the qualitative data, refine implementation approaches and identify active intervention components to support behaviour change. Based on the phase 1 study findings, we have adapted the FINGER multicomponent intervention for use in the context of adults with Type 2 DM in a community setting in Ireland. The study protocol has now been amended to ensure patient and staff safety for delivery of the interventions during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. We wish to test the acceptability/feasibility of this culturally tailored multicomponent intervention for prevention of cognitive impairment in the target population using a RCT design. PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Study Design This proposal comprises a 9‐month evaluation feasibility/pilot study using parallel group RCT design. Participants will be recruited from both sides of the border using 2 study centres: Sligo (catchment Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan) and South Western Area Hospital, (SWAH‐catchment Tyrone/Fermanagh). Methodologies A total of 140 (70 from Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan and 70 from Tyrone/Fermanagh) non‐demented individuals aged ≥ 50 years within 5 years of Type 2 DM diagnosis will be recruited. Those eligible and willing to take part will give informed written consent, and will be randomized to either intensive lifestyle intervention or control (35 participants in each group in each site). All participants will receive general information on brain health in DM at baseline. Participants randomised to control group will receive standard clinical care and be provided with pedometers to wear to record their walking activity while those randomised to the intensive lifestyle intervention will receive a community���based multicomponent programme involving a 4‐month active intervention delivered online, followed by a 2‐month self‐directed consolidation stage. The 4‐month active intervention will involve online delivery of the following components: 1. Diet 2. Physical Activity 3. Cognitive stimulation 4. Metabolic and vascular risk factor management. The 4‐month active intervention will be followed by a 2‐month self‐directed consolidation phase that will include: ‐ Fortnightly text message reminders as above regarding program targets to include: diet/cognitive stimulation/ exercise/ vascular risk awareness ‐ Monthly phone calls from the study nurse17 to discuss any issues arising and encourage compliance with the intervention18. The study nurse will telephone participants to review progress in achieving MIND diet and activity and brain training goals and offer positive reinforcement, encouragement and support to continue with the lifestyle changes. ‐ Participants will also be able to telephone the nurse outside the scheduled calls if and when required. All participants will then be left to their own initiative for a further 3 months. Participants will meet the researcher at SWAH research centre or their home at baseline, 4, 6 and 9 months for a study assessment that is anticipated to last no longer than 90 minutes. Study visits will be conducted according to local SWAH covid19 protocols and research staff will wear recommended personal protective equipment. Each study visit will involve obtaining a non‐fasting blood sample, measurement of blood pressure and anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference) and completion of questionnaires. Primary outcomes will include feasibility measures: participation rates; drop‐outs; compliance; application of prescribed trial methodology. Acceptability and compliance with these lifestyle interventions will be assessed formally using validated patient questionnaires at each time‐point and through interviews with compliers and non‐compliers including a sample of participants who dropped out. Secondary outcomes will be global cognitive function, cardiometabolic risk factors and physical performance. Behavioural measures Diet: Four‐day prospective food records, MIND diet score questionnaire. Exercise: muscle strength training and aerobic exercise will be recorded in diaries; participants will be provided with pedometers for objective exercise assessment. Cognition/social: Activity diaries will quantify participation in social and cognitive activities and use of cognitive training platform (time, frequency and nature of activities). The Brain HQ platform allows recording of the extent of cognitive training. Health Measures: Vascular and metabolic risk factors: pulse and blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, lipid profile, cholesterol, renal function Cognitive and psychological functions will be formally measured using Catch‐Cog, Trail Making Test and Delayed Word Recall tests at each assessment. Physical performance will be measured using 'timed get up and go' and '6‐minute walk test' at each assessment. The need for use of controls This study will test the value of an intensive intervention regimen in people with Type 2 DM. It is important to study acceptability and adherence to such an intervention and to examine whether adherence results in any changes in predefined outcomes, particularly uptake of lifestyle recommendations. Thus, it is necessary to randomly allocate patients with Type 2 DM to a control group to receive routine care. From an ethical perspective the control group will receive the standard of clinical care as defined by national guidelines. Data protection issues All data will be collected and stored according to Data Protection legislation (NI and ROI). Subjects will be allocated a unique study number so they cannot be identified individually and these databases will be stored separately. Data for this study will be stored securely, according to each institutional data protection policy. For example, within the UK, data is stored according to the Data Protection Act. Similarly, using the UK as an example, stringent internal processes are followed. The Centre for Public Health (CPH) senior management team regularly reviews Quality Control procedures in place within the Centre. CPH have systems in place to ensure that all data handling is carried out in accordance with rigorous internally controlled quality assurance standards with particular attention to confidentiality, data protection and data archiving. Data collected in association with this study will be anonymised and archived in password‐protected study databases and will be retained for 10 years in accordance with UK RC policy. Methods of data collection, and methods of data analysis Baseline assessment, 4 and 6 months assessments: full demographic characteristics {(age, social class and/ or educational attainment) gender, comorbidity, medication, BMI, weight, bloods}); Cognitive and physical performance assessment using Catch Cog, Trails and delayed word recall tests; timed get up and go and six minute walk tests. Primary outcomes include feasibility measures: participation rates; drop‐outs; compliance; qualitative (FG) and questionnaire based evaluation of trial processes; application of prescribed trial methodology. Feasibility and compliance with these interventions will also be formally assessed using questionnaires and through Focus Groups, sampling participants to ensure maximum variability and representation of hard to reach groups. Data collection will involve paper methods for all questionnaires and outcomes. Cognitive training records will be obtained from online activity. Further steps needed and/or envisaged outcome for future work The objective is to proceed to a definitive large‐scale study. Our findings will enable refinement of protocol and statistical powering to provide a detailed application to funders for a study that is of high public health priority and that should be performed.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05304975,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02391939/full,
CN-02080183,"NCT04259489,",Effectiveness of SCDM in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04259489,2020,"Diabetes is a complex, chronic illness requiring continuous medical care with multifactorial risk‐reduction strategies beyond glycemic control. At present, about 114 million diabetics and 11.6% incidence rate of diabetes in China have produced huge chronic disease management pressure and created great challenges for China's limited medical resources. (1‐5). Meanwhile, with population aging and increasing prevalence of obesity in China, the number of patients with diabetes mellitus, diabetes‐related complications and related mortality are expected to further increase, which also indicates greater healthcare expenditure and socioeconomic burden. A multi‐center, cross‐sectional survey of outpatients conducted in 606 hospitals across China showed that the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes did not achieve the goal of HbA1c <7.0% (6). There are varieties of problems including inadequate patient education, inability to track the out‐of‐hospital situation of diabetes, and lack of effective patient follow‐up and education between each visits (1‐5). Many researches have proved that comprehensive diabetes management education can significantly improve the quality of life of patients, decrease the incidence and mortality of diabetes complications, and relieve the government's medical economic burden (7). Besides, A number of studies have shown that the early detection and comprehensive management of diabetes can prevent the occurrence of a variety of complications and decrease the disability rate and premature death rate of diabetes. Therefore, how to improve the current situation of diabetes control in China is very important and a real problem in front of every doctor, patient and health institution. According to the diabetes management guidelines published by American Diabetes Association(ADA) and the National Institutes of Health(NIH), continuous follow‐up of patients, diabetes self‐management education and support (DSME/S) combined with multidisciplinary team comprehensive management can be abled to achieve better management results, and it is also a more comprehensive and cost‐effective way to manage diabetic patients (8‐12). In order to support health professionals to improve medical efficiency and promote patients develop healthy lifestyle, Shared Care diabetes management model established and believe that it will provide a sustained and effective solution for improving the effectiveness of comprehensive management for patients and reducing the burden of national chronic disease management. With patient's informed consent, Patient‐related vital signs (such as height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, waist, hips), laboratory indicators (including glycated hemoglobin, low‐density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney indicators such as urine microalbumin and creatinine Ratio, glomerular filtration rate), blood glucose records, online learning frequency and other data will be uniformly recorded and comprehensively analyzed. The study evaluated and explored the effect of patient management and related factors under the Share Care management model aims to provide a clear evidence for the choice of new diagnosis and treatment strategies for patients with diabetes. All patients enrolled in the study need to go through screening, initial visit, revisit, half‐year visit and annual visit. The following is an overview of the research design. Screening: Initial visit: ‐ Basic vital signs: including height, weight, waist, hips, blood pressure, etc. ‐ Collection of metabolic indicators: HbA1c, ACR, blood biochemistry, etc. ‐ Insulin evaluation (including rotation of patients' insulin injection site, each change of needle, skin condition, preservation of insulin and correct use of insulin pen, etc.) ‐ Fundus evaluation. The Shared Care aims to provide patients with a continuous management model of omni‐directional and lifelong care management, and to strengthen diabetes self‐management education and supports (DSME/S), achieve better health outcomes and delay incidence and mortality of diabetic complications. The model consisted of a medical team that includes dietitians, diabetes educators, nurses and physical therapist led by physician, and provides comprehensive disease and health management for patients with diabetes through outpatient consultation and out‐of‐hospital online continuous management. The management strategy is adjusted and individualized based on patients' habit and situation. Compared with traditional diabetes outpatient settings, patients of Shared Care return to the hospital for regular follow‐up every three months since the initial visit after the informed consent. For each follow‐up, a comprehensive management plan is made by a multidisciplinary team, including doctor consultation, diabetes management, foot evaluation, fundus assessment, insulin injection assessment, exercise evaluation and guidance, etc. The patients download the Shared Care mobile application during the outpatient service and connect with the smart‐glucometer BG1 to upload blood glucose dairy, blood pressure diary and food log in real time. All out‐of‐hospital online diabetes educators are qualified as registered nurses. Before the start of the study, the nurses should uniformly receive training and examination related to diabetes education in the Department of Endocrinology of Chaoyang Hospital. The main contents of online education include personalized assessment and suggestions on diet, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia events, drug use and insulin preservation as directed by doctors, and on blood glucose monitoring and reminders for revisit every three months, etc. In case of special circumstances or prescription adjustment, online diabetes educators should follow the training process to summarize the patient's condition with the doctor on the same day or during the weekly regular outpatient clinic, or arrange additional subsequent visit of the patient, all online consultation process is carried out under the supervision of the doctor (the diabetes educator spends about 5 minutes a week to discuss the condition of special patients with the doctor according to the actual situation). The model enables both patients and medical teams to carry out real‐time data sharing, intelligent analysis and remote monitoring, thus significantly improving management efficiency and releasing medical resources. ‐ Check the inclusion / exclusion criteria to confirm whether subjects are eligible to participate in the study. After confirming, the subjects will be randomly divided into the shared care group or the traditional therapy group according to the random number table. ‐ The number and days of emergency visits or hospitalizations due to diabetes‐related factors (diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmotic coma, severe hypoglycemia) in the past three months before joining the study ‐ Filling in and recording the related behavior scale (summary of diabetes self‐care activities (SDSCA), chinese diabetes management self‐efficacy scale(C‐DMSES), adjusted diabetes‐specific quality of life scale (A‐DQOL), morisky drug compliance scale and depression‐anxiety‐stress scale (DASS‐21)). ‐ Foot evaluation. ‐ Health education. ‐ Daily medicine cost of patients Revisit (every three months): ‐ Basic vital signs: including height, weight, waist, hips, blood pressure, etc. ‐ Collection of metabolic indicators: HbA1c, ACR, blood biochemistry, etc. ‐ Daily medicine cost of patients half‐year visit (every 6 months from the initial visit) needs to be added on the basis of the index of revisit. A series of preliminary studies had been conducted in Chaoyang Hospital since January 2018. mean age of patients enrolled was 54.69 ± 11.14 years; the duration of diabetes was more than 7.8 ±7.0 years, and more than 70% were complicated with hypertension and / or dyslipidemia. The baseline glycemic achieving rate of patients with a duration more than 10 years was less than 35%. After participated in the Shared Care management model, glycemic achieving rate of patients with diabetic was more than 75%. Compared with the baseline HbA1c 7.4±1.5%, patients HbA1c in the latest follow‐up was 6.6 ±1.0%, with the average decreased of 0.8 ±1.6% (P <0.05). The 3B achieving rate (HbA1c <7%, LDL‐C < 2.6mmol/L, BP <130/80mmHg) of patients under the management of Shared Care Model was 21.84%. The baseline urinary microalbuminuria / creatinine (UACR) 35.8mg/g was not significantly increased compared with the last follow‐up of 32.1mg/g (P>0.10). The daily cost of hypoglycemic medicine was significantly reduced in patients with the duration of diabetes less than 2 years or 15 years or more (medicine daily cost of the baseline and the latest follow‐up was 3.5 RMB per day and 2.3 RMB per day respectively in patients with the duration of diabetes less than 2 years (P<0.05); medicine daily cost of the baseline and the latest follow‐up was 10.4 RMB per day and 9.5 RMB per day respectively in patients with the duration of diabetes of 15 years or more (P<0.05)), but there was no significant increase in patients with other durations of diabetes. 210 patients with type 2 diabetes who met the criteria were enrolled. All patients with informed consent will undergo basic interviews, vital sign measurements and related biochemical tests. During the screening phase, the following variables will be collected: age, sex, smoking status (current smokers, former smokers, non‐smokers), duration of diabetes, duration of dyslipidemia, concomitant diseases and medication, etc. Besides, vital signs, 12‐lead electrocardiogram, regular blood test and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the patient's blood lipid spectrum includes total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio(ACR) and safety laboratory measurements (creatine kinase, SCr, BUN, UA, ALT, AST) also will be collected. The designated researcher will conduct a serum pregnancy test on all fertile women. The body mass index ((BMI)) is calculated by dividing weight by the square of height (kg / m2). After fasting overnight for 8 to 12 hours, the blood samples were collected before breakfast the next day. EGFR will be calculated using a Modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD). ‐ The number and days of emergency visits or hospitalizations in the last three months (or since the last visit) due to diabetes‐related factors (diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmotic coma, severe hypoglycemia) ‐ Basic vital signs: including height, weight, waist, hips, blood pressure, etc. ‐ Collection of metabolic indicators: HbA1c, ACR, blood biochemistry, etc. ‐ The number and days of emergency visits or hospitalizations in the last three months (or since the last visit) due to diabetes‐related factors (diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmotic coma, severe hypoglycemia). ‐ Daily medicine cost of patients. ‐ Insulin evaluation.

Around 1.5 million deaths globally, are directly attributed to diabetes each year. Adults with diabetes have a two‐ to three‐fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, approximately, one million people were blinded due to diabetes. Also, Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure. Uncontrolled DM2 has a negative impact on the healthcare system, patients, and community. Similarly, it has an adverse impact on the quality of life by its harmful complications that increase patients' disabilities, high hospitalization rates, and 30‐day readmissions rate. Patients with DM2 have a high prevalence of DM‐related stress. Additionally, a lack of diabetes awareness threatened patients' self‐esteem stability, autonomy, and patient's ability to self‐care and manage . in Jordan, about 74.5 % of patients with DM had uncontrolled diabetes, despite their good knowledge level about diabetes and its complications. however, this knowledge did not translate into the ability to change patients 'behaviors regard to self‐care activities this means that we need more innovative programs that encourage patients to utilize the knowledge they have . Several unstructured diabetes self‐management education (DSME) aimed to increase patients' awareness of the disease and its management was performed in most healthcare settings, this type of education has a short‐term impact on patients' attitudes toward self‐care activities. a significant gap in primary care about diabetes‐related knowledge and practices in caring for patients with diabetes, Previous research has documented a lack of sufficient communication about DSME between patients and physicians. Diabetes care and education shall be designed with the integration of patient‐centered care (PCC), which is a model of clinical practice aimed at shifting patient‐provider relationships from authoritarianism to shared decision‐making, PCC was described as ""providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions"". For enhancing diabetes self‐management many educational programs were designed and examined in several studies, the ADA has recommended using the Diabetes self‐management education and support (DSMES), which is an education and support model of care designed and provided using a PCC that respects patients' needs and surrounded context with coordination of diabetes nurse and other health care providers efforts, to achieve the seven self‐care behaviors of a patient as reliable outcome measures of diabetes self‐management "" being active, healthy eating, taking medication, monitoring, solving problems, reducing risks and healthy coping"" . Applying the DSMES program produces behavioral changes, empowerment, and cost‐effectiveness. In addition, it has a positive impact on health outcomes such as reduces diabetes distress, improves the quality of life, self‐efficacy, empowerment, healthy coping, knowledge, and self‐care behaviors. The available evidence suggests that DSME enhance glycemic control but it's not enough alone, many educated patients have well knowledge about diabetes and its management, but they didn't adhere to self‐care activities. some literature argues that patients with diabetes need ongoing follow‐up and support by diabetes specialists to enhance patients abilities on managing themselves. There have been growing efforts to implement new approaches for self‐management interventions that improve diabetes control . Recently, information technology use has increased dramatically resulting in improved communication. Social Media is defined as the Internet‐based tools that permit individuals to communicate, gather and share information, ideas, and images, and to team up with other users in real‐time.

Study objective: The study objective is to compare home use of fully closed‐loop glucose control applying ultra‐rapid Lispro insulin with standard insulin pump therapy with CGM. 1. EFFICACY: The objective is to assess the efficacy of fully closed‐loop glucose control applying ultra‐rapid Lispro insulin in maintaining CGM glucose levels within the target range from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l, as compared to standard insulin pump therapy combined with CGM. 2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of fully closed‐loop glucose control in terms of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and other adverse events and adverse device effects. 3. UTILITY: The objective is to determine the percentage of time when closed‐loop was operational, and usability and acceptance of the closed‐loop system. Participating clinical centres: Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Sample Size: 24 adults completing the study. Up to 30 participants will be recruited to allow for dropouts. Maximum duration of study for a participant: 20 weeks (5 months) Recruitment The participants will be recruited through the adult diabetes outpatient clinics or other established methods. Consent: Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent. Baseline Assessment: Eligible participants will undergo a baseline evaluation including a blood sample for the measurement of HbA1c, renal, liver functions, full blood count, thyroid functions and coeliac antibody screen (if not done in the previous 3 months). Urine pregnancy test will be done in females of child bearing age. Human factor questionnaires will be administered. Run‐in Period During the 2‐3 week run‐in period, participants will use their own insulin pump and wear a masked CGM system. At the end of the run‐in period, for compliance, at least 10 days of CGM data need to be recorded. CGM data during the run‐in period will be used to assess baseline glucose control before the start of the first home study phase. Randomisation: Eligible participants will be randomised using randomisation software to the use of closed‐loop glucose control or to standard pump therapy with CGM. There will be no washout period between the two intervention periods. Automated closed‐loop: Training on the use of closed‐loop will be provided by the research team during a 2 to 3 hour session in an outpatient setting (clinical research facility) or may be done remotely. Competency on the use of study insulin pump, study CGM and closed‐loop system will be evaluated using a competency assessment tool developed by the research team. Further training may be delivered as required. Participants will be advised to use the closed‐loop system with ultra‐rapid Lispro insulin for next 8 weeks. Conventional insulin pump therapy with CGM: Participants will use their own insulin pump and study CGM. Training on the use of real‐time CGM and how to interpret real‐time will be provided. Participants will use standard insulin pump therapy, with their usual insulin, and real‐time CGM for the next 8 weeks. Cross‐over Assessment: At the end of the first intervention period, a blood sample for the measurement of HbA1c will be taken and human factor questionnaires will be administered. End of study assessments: A blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c and human factor questionnaires will be administered. Study devices will be returned and participants will resume usual care. Procedures for safety monitoring during trial: Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events and adverse device events will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia. A data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated adverse device/method effects that occur during the study and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals. Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds: A participant may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are: ‐ Serious adverse events ‐ Significant protocol violation or non‐compliance ‐ Failure to satisfy competency assessment ‐ Decision by the investigator, or the sponsor, that termination is in the participant's best medical interest ‐ Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding ‐ Allergic reaction to insulin ‐ Technical grounds (e.g. participant relocates)",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04977908,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Insulin",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02297023/full,
CN-01560159,"NCT02971241,",Intergenerational mHealth Diabetes Program OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IN TAIWAN,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02971241,2016,"The research design is a randomized waitlist control trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the immediate intervention group or 4‐month waitlist control group. The former will immediately join the tablet computer courses, while the later will wait for four (4) months before starting their courses. The follow‐up period for patients will be one (1) year after the start of courses. Patient assessments will include baseline and follow‐up assessments of health behaviors, functional status, health conditions, and social interactions and engagements, plus technology use and acceptance. Baseline assessment will be conducted at recruitment for all patients, and for waitlist control group again at the beginning of the course. Follow‐up assessments will be conducted at four (4) months, eight (8) months, and twelve (12) months after the start date of the courses. Young volunteers will also be assessed to understand their experiences in the volunteering services and any impact from this experience. The assessments will be conducted at the baseline, during the courses, and two (2) months and four (4) months after the beginning of the courses. In addition, a group of 140 young adults will be recruited from universities to serve as the comparison group and will be asked to complete the assessment survey at baseline, two (2) months, and four (4) months later. For older adults: Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be referred by doctors in the metabolism and endocrinology department of the two hospitals to recruiters and will be randomly assigned to immediate intervention group and waitlist control group. The aim of the comparison is to assess the potential effects of mobile technology program with intergenerational interaction on patients' technology use, self‐efficacy, self‐management behavior, and social engagement, and whether it results in less social isolation and health care utilization, improved health and mental health status, and greater quality of life. Recruitment procedure: 1. Tzu Chi diabetes health educators will recruit patients with type 2 diabetes and screen them for eligibility. The health educators will complete a patient contact card for each patient that they screen for eligibility. If eligible, the health educators will explain the study to the patients and ask for their interest to participate. Interested patients will be referred to an IMTOP study recruiter. The recruiter will collect all patient contact cards and completed screeners from the health educators. 2. The study recruiters on site in the hospital will obtain the informed consent from the eligible and interested patients. When the patients sign the study consent, the recruiter will write on the patient contact card the patient ID next to Study Participation Status ‐ Enrolled, and complete the patient contact card. 3. The recruiter will then conduct the baseline interview. Baseline interview can be done face to face or via telephone if patient prefers. 4. Patient's study group (immediate intervention or wait list control group) will be randomly assigned at the study's Qualtrics database after baseline interview is complete. 5. All recruitment paper, if any, will be sent to the project manager to file on a locked cabinet. 6. The patients who are randomized to the immediate intervention group will be assigned to the training course as soon as a course is available. The patients randomized to the waitlist control group will need to wait for six months to serve as no intervention control, and then assigned to the training course. Description of intervention: The intervention is a 12‐week program which consists of 8‐week training sessions followed by 4‐week consultation service for technical support. Both will be provided by the young volunteers. The themes of the 8‐week training session are designed based on the objectives of IMTOP: 1) teach skills of tablet use, 2) introduce online community communication to decrease social isolation and obtain social support from family and friends, young volunteers, health care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease), 3) teach diabetes self‐management knowledge and skills based on the evidence‐based Chronic Disease Self‐Management Program; and 4) teach mobile technology application to healthcare access and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e‐newspaper, e‐books, related sites, apps). Moreover, the enrolled older adults will be invited to use a diabetes self‐management behavior tracking app developed by the research team. The app is designed to encourage diabetes patients to regularly record their diet, physical activity, water consumption, medication adherence, blood sugar readings, and blood pressure readings. The data will be used for our research analysis to understand to what extent the older adults use the app and whether regular recording has impact on the outcome measures. The 4‐week consultation service post the 8‐week training course is intended as additional support for the older adults who encounter technical issues when using the tablet on their own. To receive the technical support, the older adults shall call the study hotline or post their questions on the study website to explain the technical issues. The research staff will find a study volunteer to address the technical issues. During the training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to 90‐min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the taping/photo shooting. Accrual and baseline data collection: University of Southern California (USC) research team will prepare enrollment packages (including an information sheet, the screener, the patient contact card, the consent form, HIPPA form and a 40‐minute baseline survey). Health educators employed by two Tzu Chi Hospitals will help enroll and consent eligible patients. Participating patients will be asked to sign the HIPPA authorization form to release their medical records in hospitals. Consenting patients will be invited to take baseline survey through an interview with a study interviewer, either in‐person or by phone based on patient's preference. When baseline survey is completed, patients will be randomly assigned to intervention group and wait‐list control group. Follow‐up survey: For immediate intervention patients, 4‐month, 8‐month, and 12‐month follow‐up surveys will be administered via telephone by part‐time interviewers employed for the study by the hospitals. For wait‐list control group patients, 4‐month, 8‐month, 12‐month, and 16‐month follow‐up surveys will be administered via telephone by the part‐time interviewers. Study data will be obtained from patients' self‐report on study assessments, study tracking records such as the training course attendance, and patients' medical records pertaining to diabetes care and healthcare utilizations in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals. Self‐report data collected from patients include demographic characteristics, physical health and mental health status, self‐management behaviors, health care utilization, health literacy, self‐efficacy, social engagement, and quality of life. The study assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes. For young volunteers: Accrual and baseline data collection: IMTOP research staff and employees (such as diabetes health educators) of the Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals will distribute young volunteer recruitment flyers to officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities nearby the study sties. The IMTOP research staff will also arrange meetings at university campuses to introduce the study and call for volunteers. The study information and the call for volunteers will be disseminated campus wide two months prior to each IMTOP training term starts. Young adults who are interested in participating in the study as volunteer instructors for the training course will sign up at the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The sign‐up section of the website will explicitly show the language that enrollment in the study means a volunteer is not only serving as an instructor but also as a research participant. To complete the sign up will require acknowledgment of the dual roles. There will be a study hotline number shown on the recruitment flyer for interested young adults to get more information about the study and for sign‐up. The research staff will contact those young adults who meet the study inclusion criteria for an interview to clarify the job responsibilities and the expectations. Those who agree to meet the expectations will be invited to attend the two‐day training workshop (described below). On the day of the training workshop, the young adults will be asked to consent for their study participation and to complete the study baseline. Then they will be accepted for the study enrollment as young volunteers. The target recruitment is 140 volunteers. USC research team will prepare the enrollment package (including the recruitment flyer, the sign‐up form, the consent form, and a 40‐minute self‐administered baseline survey). The sign‐up and the consent form will be available via the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The self‐administered surveys will be available on qualtrics website via a web link in the study website. Orientation workshop: USC research team will provide two orientation workshops for enrolled volunteers to learn skills and knowledge for delivering the intervention service. The topics of orientation workshops include young volunteers' role and responsibilities in the IMTOP research project, knowledge of aging process, motivational interviewing skills, problem solving skills, empathy, communication with older adults, and introduction of the 8‐week training curriculum and the 4‐week technical support. Volunteering services: After the orientation workshop is successfully completed, young volunteers will be assigned to be one of about 4 instructing volunteers to provide the tablet training for a group of approximately 10 older adults with type 2 diabetes. The training course is 2 hours per session and 1 session per week for 8 weeks long. In each session, there is a prepared course material for the volunteers to deliver to the older adults, such as use of web browsers, application of social media, and online supporting materials for the older adults to learn mobile technology for their self‐management to improve health and quality of life. After the 8‐week training period, the young volunteers will provide 4‐week technical support for the diabetes outpatients via phone or mobile device. During the tablet training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to 120‐min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the taping/photo shooting. Baseline and follow‐up survey: The enrolled young volunteers will be asked to complete the self‐administered online surveys at baseline and at 2‐month and 4‐month follow up. That is, the baseline will be completed prior to the intervention. The 2‐month follow‐up will be completed immediately after the 8‐week training course. The 4‐month follow‐up will be completed one month after the 4‐week technical support period. The survey will collect data about demographic characteristics, level of empathy, citizenship behavior, time management skills, altruism value, purpose of life, and career development. In addition, the young volunteers will be asked to take turn in recording the class log, including the class attendance, materials taught, Q&A, any difficulty or questions in delivering the curriculum, and other relevant observations or issues. Additionally, once a month for a total of three times, once in week 4 and once in week 8 during the 8‐week course, plus once in the end of the 4‐week technical support, they will be asked to write a short reflection of their volunteering experience. These study assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes. For young adult comparison group: A group of 140 young adults similar to the young volunteers will be recruited from universities through information meetings held by the research staff in collaboration with officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities. They will not be randomized, but instead they will be deliberately recruited to be the comparison group that matches with the young volunteer group on the bases of age range, college attendance and major, and location of the schools. These young adults will be informed to serve as the comparison group for the study. Once consented, they will be directed to answer the same self‐administered online surveys at baseline and at 2‐month and 4‐month follow up. Data Storage and Confidentiality: 1. All questionnaires completed electronically via the web‐based survey company qualtrics, license available through the USC Information Technology Services (http://www.usc.edu/its/qualtrics/), will be kept in the secure website of qualtrics and then downloaded into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. The following links show privacy, acceptable use, and security statements provided by qualtrics: http://www.qualtrics.com/privacy‐statement/ http://www.qualtrics.com/acceptable‐use‐statement/ http://www.qualtrics.com/security‐statement/ 2. Data collected on the study website IMTOP.usc.edu will be stored in secure and password protected website at Amazon Cloud Drive, and then downloaded into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. 3. A password protected secure computer file linking identifying information and the subject study ID will be securely maintained under control of Dr. Wu and the study Data Analyst in the School of Social Work. 4. All study data files will only contain subject IDs, not identifying information. 5. Analysis and publication of the data will employ procedures making it impossible to identify individuals. 6. After completion of the study, identifiable data such as video tapes will be destroyed, but the remaining data will be retained at the researchers discretion and may be used in future research studies. .. 7. All study investigators and staff have already or will complete the USC IRB and required HIPAA certification course. Hardcopy study data will be kept in the secure location in the USC School of Social Work or in a designated locked cabinet in the collaborating Tzu Chi hospitals for a period of 5 years following study completion, after which it will be destroyed. Study tracking data will also be kept on a secure, password protected, web‐site maintained by the School of Social Work within the Hamovitch Research Center. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT Potential Risks: There are no anticipated risks to subjects' participation in this study. The tablet training program takes place in Taipei or Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital. Subjects' participation in the program may involve normal risks in transportation to attend the training sessions. Frequency and intensity of training sessions might cause them certain level of anxiety and discomfort, such as soreness in eye. As the study subjects will also participate in the study surveys, some of the survey questions may make them uncomfortable or concerned, but they can choose not to answer any questions they do not wish to answer. Participating in research may involve a loss of privacy, but all of the information the subjects provide will be kept confidential. The possibility of a breach of privacy to occur is very low but will exist as long as we hold the data. All participants will be advised that they are free not to use the technology and not to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable. However, in previous studies of depressed patients, distress resulting from interviews and questionnaires has been minimal. Subjects may experience inconvenience and time costs associated with using technology and completing study interviews; however, all interventions and interviews are completely voluntary and will be conducted at the participant' convenience. The technology intervention does not expose patients to additional or unusual medications or side effects. Although all efforts will be made to protect patient confidentiality, those patients who experience critical clinical events (e.g., hypoglycemia) during the study training sessions or those who are likely victims of abuse may experience loss of confidentiality as study staff will be required to report these events to the subject's physician for appropriate safety measures to be taken. Risk Classification: The risks of this study are consistent with the HHS/FDA Regulations definition of minimal risk. Protection Against Risks: The study PIs and the project manger who has a gerontology and public health background will train the study recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers to handle distressed or potentially at risk patients during recruitment, intervention, and assessment. The recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will request permission from distressed subjects to notify their physician so that they may be assessed and treated as necessary. In the case of emergengy, the recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will inform the patient of the immediate need to notify the patient's physician, even without his or her permission, so that these providers may take appropriate action to ensure patient safety. This will involve using usual clinic channels to have the patient urgently evaluated and and appropriate disposition arranged (including possible transport to Emergency Department in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals). The study principal investigator in the local site will be available by cellular phone and will also be notified of emergency patients in order to to ensure timely assessment and treatment by a physician. Data Safety Monitoring Plan: All assessment data will be entered into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. Study patients will be identified by a unique study code number, the identity of which will be known only to the study personnel with direct responsibility for providing patient data. The database will be password protected against non‐project personnel and backed up weekly. This removes patient‐identifiable data from the files. The data manager and biostatistician will create a series of databases in Excel and SAS, so that they can analyze the initial data as it comes in to ensure proper patient recruitment, track progress of the study, and perform data checks and cleaning. All baseline and follow‐up data, including responses to the screener questionnaire, will be entered on qualtrics web‐based survey system through tablets or other computer devices onsite. The data will be identified by the patient's study ID code. This data will be transmitted either wirelessly, through third or forth generation mobile telecommunications, or through the local network connection in real time to the qualtrics server as data is entered by recruiters on the computer devices, which has been loaded with the requisite software and encryption system. The transmitted data will be encrypted using HIPAA‐compliant encryption and password protected. If there is poor wireless connection or mobile telecommunication transmission is not possible, recruiters will enter baseline and follow‐up data on paper forms. All forms will be checked for completeness by the qualtric systems or, if paper, by the study coordinator before being sent to the project manager. The project manager will review and double‐check all of the forms to be sure they are completed and readable. For data on paper forms, data will be entered singly using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC) full screen editor (FSEDIT) into SAS database system with back‐up copy and hard copy kept in secure locked file cabinet in the SSW. For data on the qualtrics server, data would be downloaded onto local sites into the SAS database system with back‐up copy password‐protected. Accuracy of data entry will be ensured by an internal program with FSEDIT for range and logic check, and by a comparison between printouts and the handwritten data forms. To assist in monitoring the study, periodic reports will be generated using graphs and tables summarizing the status of subject recruitment and data collection. Missing data will be routinely rectified. SAS will also be used to analyze the data and generate all statistical reports. Data on the qualtrics server and the project website will be destroyed at the end of the study. Potential Benefits to the Subject and/or Society: Direct benefits to patients who participate IMTOP study include learning: 1) skills of tablet use, 2) online community communication with family and friends, young volunteers, health care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease, 3) diabetes self‐management knowledge and skills; and 4) mobile technology application to health access and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e‐newspaper, e‐books, related sites, apps) at no or minimal out‐of‐pocket cost (e.g., transportation cost to attend the training course). There is a potential of improving the flow of communication between these patients and their health educators as well as physicians through using mobile technology. Self‐management knowledge and behaviors will improve among them. Those patients in the waitlist control group may also experience benefits due to the raised levels of awareness of self‐management, and later experience the potential benefits associated with the tablet training intervention. The potential benefit to society is that IMTOP intervention is likely to create an approach to improve self‐management behaviors, health outcomes, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, with improvement in self‐monitoring behavior among older diabetes patients and raised levels of health awareness among young volunteers, medical expenses of diabetes care by the government might decrease, which benefits the society as a whole. Alternatives to Participation: Refusal to participate will not negatively impact older adults' diabetes care or their access to usually available health services. If patients are interested in learning more about diabetes self‐management skills, but do not wish to participate in the study, written educational materials in Chinese will be available. Refusal to participate among young adults, either in the volunteering group or in the comparison group, also will not have any negative impact on the younger adults. They can request to receive a copy of written educational materials in Chinese for future diabetes prevention. Risk/Benefit Relationship: The potential benefits to participants are greater than the risks associated with participation. The physical, psychological, social, and legal risks to patients with type 2 diabetes are minimal. IMTOP study aims to improve their health outcomes and quality of life. In addition, the intergenerational interactions could be a motivator for them to learn the technology to enhance their skills of self‐management, which may result in improved health and decreased cost of medical care as a whole. For young volunteers, the risk is negligible but the focus of intergenerational interactions could potentially improve their communication with and empathy for older adults, increase awareness of self‐care and disease prevention, build health‐focused values of life style, and shape future career choice. For young adults in the comparison group, although both risk and benefit are minimal, they may feel a sense of pride through their contribution to research.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02971241,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01560159/full,

Procedures for safety monitoring during trial: ‐ Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events (AE) will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and specific adverse events such as severe hypoglycaemia. ‐ Subjects will be asked to test and record blood or urine ketones if their finger prick glucose is above 14.0 mmol/l, as part of the safety assessment for hyperglycaemia. ‐ A data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals. Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds: ‐ A subject, parent, or guardian may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are: 1. Serious adverse events 2. Significant protocol violation or non‐compliance 3. Failure to satisfy competency assessment 4. Decision by the investigator, or the Sponsor, that termination is in the subject's best medical interest 5. Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding 6.

Objectives: 1) to develop DiabeText, an intervention delivering automated, tailored brief text messages to support diabetes self‐management; 2) to explore the potential impact of DiabeText on self‐management behavior and glycaemic control, and; 3) to examine the feasibility of conducting a future phase III randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of DiabeText. Methods: 3‐month, two‐arm, randomized feasibility trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04738591) with patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 8%). Participants were allocated to the control (usual care) or DiabeText group (usual care + five text messages per week). Outcomes were: recruitment rate; follow‐up rate, missing data; medication adherence; adherence to Mediterranean diet; physical activity; and HbA1c. In addition, after delivering the intervention, we conducted a qualitative study involving 14 semi‐structured interviews with participants allocated to the DiabeText group, to understand their views about the intervention. Results: From 444 screened people, we recruited 207 participants (recruitment rate = 47%), of which 179 completed the post‐intervention interview (follow‐up rate = 86%). We sent 7,355 SMS during the intervention period, of which 99% successfully reached the participants. At post‐intervention, DiabeText was associated with non‐statistically significant (p > 0.05) improvements in adherence to medication (OR = 2.0; 95%CI 1.0 to 4.2), Mediterranean diet (1.7; 0.9 to 3.2), and physical activity (1.7; 0.9 to 3.1). No between‐group differences were observed in mean HbA1c (p = 0.670). The qualitative study indicated that participants perceived DiabeText as a helpful resource because it increased their awareness about the importance of adequate self‐management and the sense of being cared for. Conclusions: DiabeText is the first system in Spain to integrate patient‐generated and routinely collected clinical data to deliver tailored text messages to support diabetes self‐management.

The study population comprises adults who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test above 8% in the past year. All members of the study population are treated at primary care clinics under the auspices of the Utah Beacon Community Program, which aims to improve health through use of health information technology. We will compare outcomes in two groups within this population: patients with DM who enroll in Care4Life (in addition to receiving standard care) to patients with DM who receive standard care from their physician. We will compare these groups both within the clinic and at an aggregated, overall level. This study relies on the use of information and communications technology (ICT) in supporting patient‐empowerment strategies. Features of successful diabetes care programs for improving adherence to standards of care, such as the use of diabetes self‐management education, checklists that mirror guidelines, and automated reminders are well suited to delivery using an interactive mobile health platform. Research Questions This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Care4Life mHealth program by: 1. Evaluating if a short message service via cell phone texting (SMS) protocol will lead to improvements in clinical, utilization and satisfaction outcomes for patients with DM compared to patient who receive standard care. 2. Evaluating if an SMS protocol can be readily adopted by an adult population in both urban and rural areas with a time‐consuming chronic illness. Targeted outcomes include: 1. Improved measures of diabetes control, demonstrated as HbA1c percentage levels ≤ 8%; improved blood pressure (BP) control, demonstrated as BP ≤ 140/90 millimeters mercury (mm Hg); and lower body mass index (BMI) among users of the SMS‐based tool. 2. Improved knowledge of self‐care and disease management practices among adult patients with diabetes treated in Beacon clinics in the Salt Lake Metropolitan Statistical Area (Salt Lake, Tooele, and Summit counties). 3. Dissemination of results and proof of concept with the broader healthcare community in Utah. The mobile centric diabetes support service at the center of our study is Voxiva's Care4Life platform, which is an interactive mobile application designed to educate participants, encourage behavior change and promote adherence to their prescribed DM treatment protocol. It includes a series of SMS‐based tools that have been developed in collaboration with the Instituto Carso de la Salud, located in Mexico. The service sends content relevant to the target participants and their standard treatment protocol. Care4Life delivers an individually tailored diabetes education and management plan based on data that are collected from patients at enrollment and added to the participant's personal health profile. The SMS protocol draws on the experience of a number of interventions that have been independently studied and shown to improve health outcomes. Care4Life functionality consists of the following components: (1) a diabetes diary that can be used to develop a history of glucose levels and trigger alerts and feedback based on the participant's results; (2) health education with content tailored to the participant's health profile; (3) medication adherence reminders and monitoring; (4) medical appointment reminders; (5) a database that allows a participant to record and monitor her/his weight, BMI, blood pressure and laboratory results; and (6) a health portal that allows a participant to review his/her data, obtain advice and guidance based on the information entered, and manage his/her preferences.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT01546844,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01535948/full,
CN-01480924,"NCT00288132,",The Diabetes TeleCare Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00288132,2006,"According to recent 2002 estimates, the yearly cost of diabetes was approximately $132 billion. The burden of diabetes is considerable, particularly for ethnically diverse populations. Disease management programs that focus on self‐management education have been effective in improving metabolic control. Accordingly, the American Diabetes Association clinical care guidelines stress the importance of metabolic control to prevent complications and improve quality of life for persons with this disease. Unfortunately, these advances have not resulted in widespread acceptance into clinical practice. Therefore, we propose translational research to evaluate telemedicine technology using interactive video conferencing (Diabetes TeleCare) as a novel means to increase the availability of health professionals in rural communities for the effective delivery of a diabetes self‐management education program and as a means to provide retinal screenings in the primary care setting. Our aims are to 1) develop and implement a 12‐month intervention, Diabetes TeleCare to improve adherence to diabetes clinical care guidelines and improve diabetes control in two community health centers located in ethnically diverse, rural and medically underserved communities, 2) conduct a one‐year randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 200 patients to formally evaluate the effectiveness of Diabetes TeleCare compared to Usual Care in a sample with >60% African‐Americans, and 3) determine the cost‐effectiveness and satisfaction of Diabetes TeleCare compared to Usual Care. Participants are recruited from two community health centers in rural South Carolina and randomized according to a patient randomization schedule. Diabetes TeleCare (a structured curriculum) is delivered by a team consisting of a registered nurse/certified diabetes educator (RN‐CDE) and an experienced registered dietitian, with support by other health professionals who are linked by interactive video conferencing to participants (single and group) in rural health centers at distant locations. The primary outcomes are measures of metabolic control (A1c, lipids), blood pressure, and use of the telemedicine‐facilitated retinal screening capacity. Secondary outcomes include satisfaction, quality of life, health beliefs, and knowledge. The economic analysis will include an assessment of resource utilization, cost, and health utilities. In addition, incremental reductions in costs per A1c and the estimated lifetime cost‐utility of Diabetes TeleCare compared to usual care will be determined. Telemedicine may be an effective alternative to traditional health care delivery systems resulting in improved diabetes education and control. The intervention goal was to achieve an A1c <7%, with secondary goals of 10% weight loss and increasing exercise to at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Participants attend 13 sessions, 2 in the first month (1 group, 1 individual), monthly thereafter (9 group, 2 individual). Three group sessions were conducted in‐person, all others were conducted via telemedicine. The self‐management education team consisted of an RN/CDE and an RD. Sessions were conducted remotely, with a trained facilitator (LPN) at the clinic site. Participants were given a notebook and new material was added at each session. Completion of self‐monitoring logs, including blood sugar, diet and physical activity, was assigned daily followed by less frequently based on progress towards intervention goals.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT00288132,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01480924/full,
CN-01547936,"NCT02214017,",Telemedicine Strategy With Home Treatment Save Resources,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02214017,2014,"Chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension, represent a significant burden of disease Chronic diseases also impose huge costs on the health care systems responsible for managing them as well as their significance for those affected. Non‐pharmacological treatment is mandatory for type 2 diabetes patients characterized by central obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and overeating (1). Secondary failure to reach treatment goals despite an extensive National diabetes rehabilitation program in Denmark is often seen (2). Outpatient control shows positive effects on outpatient rehabilitation (3) reducing HbA1c, weight, and blood pressure. However, some patients never accomplish good diabetes regulation and in others regulation deteriorates over time. New approaches are required and need testing to motivate and give feedback to the patients at home. Telemedicine has the capacity to achieve this, where a diabetic nurse may optimize motivation, treatment, and diet through direct feedback adapted to milieu of the patient in accordance with a potential spouse. Good metabolic control is important as diabetes is inevitable a factor for increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy (4). The quality of life and reduction in work ability is affected, thus, life expectancy is shortened by 6‐8 years. Multi‐factorial intervention may delay this (5). The high incidence of the serious implications strengthens the importance of achieving good metabolic control through lifestyle changes. Health education shows reduction in cardiovascular risk factors (6‐8), which often disappears after the end of the intervention (6‐8). Good self‐care and compliance improve the outcome and reduces diabetes complications (9) and we need new tools to achieve higher attendance to the National diabetes program. Telemedicine represents a novel tool of educating and controlling chronic diseases. It reduced HbA1c for five years with in trials designed to test video‐conferencing, clinical data entry and review, web‐based education materials, and monitored chat groups (10). Home telemonitoring was compared with telephone calls reducing the HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes (11) and the technology confer a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0.5 % when applied as add‐on to standard treatment. It was used adjunctively to a broader telemedicine initiative for adults with diabetes. The largest telemedicine study initiated by the Ministry of Health in England (Whole Systems Demonstrator) randomized 3320 patients [12] with heart failure and diabetes to telemedicine care. It showed that the telemedicine intervention as add‐on therapy resulted a statistically significant reduction in mortality from 8.3% versus 4.6%. Similarly, it showed a reduction of number of inpatients and the number of bed days by 11% and 14%, respectively. The patients' health‐related quality of life was unchanged. The savings was less than the additional cost of using telemedicine and overall it cost 15% more per patient. This point at two important factors when applying telemedicine solutions: First, it should preferably replace the standard care and not add‐on and, second, be based on the patient's own computer, tablet or smartphone, all of which will reduce the cost substantially. Telemedicine is available for 98‐99% of all inhabitants in Denmark by broadband, which allows video conference at home. A few randomized trials with this technology are available at present. We aimed at implementing a telemedicine model in our setting and the design and method should evaluate the quality of treatment as well as technical problems and replace the standard treatment. Aim: We compared clinical data from a telemedicine group with a standard care group treated by the same medical algorithm. We wanted to reduce the barriers for the use of a home monitoring and ‐treatment among elderly, type 2 diabetes patients Hypothesis: Treatment by telemedicine or standard care in type 2 diabetes patients results in similar clinical HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids. Materials and methods: Individually visits at the outpatient clinic to plan improvement of glycemic control were made before information of the study was given. Individual goals of the treatment and the drugs needed to fulfil the objectives were agreed on. The patients received the information for the study, and if they wanted to participate, they signed an approval of participation and randomization was performed. All medical treatment, control of blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and education was executed via videotelephone in the telemedicine group In the control group patients attended usual procedure in the outpatient clinic with regular visits. Summary of recommendations for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for the participants were: HbA1c 6.5‐7.5% (48‐58 mmol/L) , fasting blood glucose 6.5‐7.5 mmol/l, diurnal blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, LDL‐cholesterol <100 mg/dL (<2.5 mmol/L) and start of medication with elevated urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ≥30 (μg/mg). The treatment algorithm was lifestyle adjustment plus antidiabetic drugs described elsewhere. When the goals were reached within 3 weeks, the videotelephone was disconnected and patients were encouraged to continue glycemic control at their general practitioner. However, the trial went on with a follow‐up and evaluation after six month according to the 'intention‐to‐treat' principle to see if a difference in the initial care mattered significantly. A videotelephone in the telemedicine group was delivered and serviced by the Danish Tele Company. The trial included type 2 diabetes patients allocated from October 2011 until July 2012 referred to the outpatient clinic from general practitioners. At entry, all patients were screened by albumin/creatinine excretion rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram, lipid profile, diabetic food control, and arteriosclerotic symptoms (angina pectoris, claudication, and fatigue). Diurnal blood pressure was measured by monitors. All measurements were repeated six months after inclusion in all participants",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02214017,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01547936/full,
CN-01701961,"NCT03800680,",A Randomized Trial to Slow the Progression of Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03800680,2019,"Technological and economic advancement have created a major challenge to public health agencies in Singapore and other first world countries: the challenge being how to get individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle when that is no longer a requirement for economic prosperity (and in fact may be a hindrance). What is required is a low cost strategy that effectively manages risk factors for chronic disease without overwhelming the public healthcare infrastructure. Although technology and economic advancement are clearly part of the problem, they may also be part of the solution. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), lifestyle modification can be highly effective at stemming the progression of the disease. Effective interventions include modules that teach appropriate strategies for weight management, increased physical activity, better diet, routine glucose monitoring, and strict compliance to prescribed diabetes medications. These components can now be effectively delivered electronically. A recent review and meta‐analysis of 13 smartphone applications for diabetes management found that these applications offered modest benefits, with a mean difference in HbA1c of ‐0.40%. Because of the high costs involved in treating people with chronic conditions, employers, insurers, and governments all have a financial incentive to contain the chronic disease epidemic. Therefore, each has shown a willingness to invest in some level of prevention and treatment efforts. It is our contention that contingent rewards may be necessary to help people overcome their preferences for current over future consumption, often called present bias. Behavioral economists recommend that, to overcome present bias, rewards should be tied to both short‐term and long‐term outcomes or behaviors, such as monitoring blood glucose and taking medications as prescribed (short term) and pre‐defined outcomes such as achieving a target HbA1c level over a specified duration (long term). Based on a recent systematic review of incentive studies conducted by members of our team, an optimal rewards strategy has the potential to greatly increase the effectiveness of existing mobile diabetes applications. If shown to be effective and cost effective, the investigators also believe payers will subsidize such a strategy. Specifically, the investigators propose to conduct a 52‐week, three‐arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether an evidence‐based, low‐cost mobile diabetes management package (DMP), with or without an incentive program grounded in economic theory, can effectively and cost‐effectively improve outcomes for adults with diabetes. The control arm (Arm 1) will receive usual care, whereas participants in the intervention arms will receive the DMP alone (Arm 2) or the DMP with the M‐POWER Rewards incentive program (Arm 3) in addition to their usual care. The investigators hypothesize that participants in Arms 2 and 3 will show improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c levels, at the Month 12 primary endpoint compared to participants in the Arm 1 control group. The investigators also hypothesize that Arm 3 will have improved HbA1c levels compared to Arm 2 at Month 12. Similar hypotheses will be tested for secondary outcomes measured at Month 6. In addition, the investigators will quantify the incremental cost‐effectiveness of DMP with M‐POWER Rewards and the net cost implications of both from a third party payer's perspective. The investigators hypothesize that despite its higher implementation cost, effectiveness will be greater and net cost will be lower for Arm 3 relative to the Arm 1 control group due to the reduction in medical expenditures that result from improved glycaemic control.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT03800680,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01701961/full,

CENTRES: Three university hospitals and the primary care centres in their area in Madrid (Clínico San Carlos, La Paz, 12 de Octubre) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the addition of 10 mg daily of dapagliflozin to the treatment of diabetic patients compared to the addition of placebo on the change in nighttime blood pressure (measured by ABPM) over 12 weeks among patients with albuminuria levels ≥ 30 and < 3000 mg/g creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: ‐ To investigate the effect of the addition of 10 mg daily of dapagliflozin to the treatment of diabetic patients compared to the addition of placebo on the change in nighttime blood pressure (measured by ABPM) over 12 weeks in the subgroup of patients with high (30‐300 mg/g creatinine) albuminuria levels. ‐ To investigate the effect of the addition of 10 mg daily of dapagliflozin to the treatment of diabetic patients compared to the addition of placebo on the change in nighttime blood pressure (measured by ABPM) over 12 weeks in the subgroup of patients with very high (>300 mg/g creatinine) albuminuria levels. ‐ Changes in albuminuria, office BP and HBA1C in the two subgroups of patients investigated METHODS: This clinical trial will be conducted according to this Protocol, under the Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 and all regulatory requirements applicable to clinical trials and following the principles of Good Clinical Practice. PATIENTS: Type 2 diabetic patients recruited in the primary care setting in the area of three university hospitals in Madrid, irrespectively of the time since diagnosis and type of treatment received for their diabetes. DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION: The drug under evaluation, dapagliflozin, is approved to be used in adults who are 18 or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus for improving glycemic control and can be used in monotherapy when diet and exercise alone do not achieve good glycemic control and metformin use is not indicated due to intolerance, or in combination with other hypoglycemic agents, including insulin, when these, added to diet and exercise do not achieve good glycemic control. In this study it will be used in agreement with the terms in which its use is authorized. The participants in the study, in addition to the treatment for their diabetes that were receiving from their attending physician, will receive 10 mg once daily of dapagliflozin or placebo resembling dapagliflozinin. The randomization scheme follows below. RANDOMIZATION: Two strata will be considered based on albuminuria levels: ‐ High albuminuria (30‐300 mg/g creatinine) ‐ Very high (>300 mg/g creatinine) Patients will be randomized to either dapagliflozin or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Total number of patients: 225; distributed as: ‐ 150 diabetic patients treated with dapagliflozin (10mg/day in a single dose), half of them with high albuminuria levels (albuminuria 30‐300 mg/g of creatinine) and half with very high albuminuria levels (albuminuria > 300 mg/g of creatinine) VISITS, VARIABLES AND MEASUREMENTS: SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS: For the main objective of the study, changes in mean nocturnal systolic blood pressure will be compared between the active treatment and placebo groups. The processing, communication and transfer of data will be in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law 15/1999, December 13th, on the protection of personal data. Trial documentation will be kept and storaged in each site for 25 years after completion of the study. ‐ 75 diabetic patients treated with placebo, half of them with high albuminuria levels (albuminuria 30‐300 mg/g of creatinine) and half with very high albuminuria levels (albuminuria > 300 mg/g of creatinine) Randomization will be stratified by albuminuria strata and participating hospital (three hospitals); center specific randomization lists (active treatment or placebo) will be prepared centrally at the project office with a treatment code assigned to each patient. Allocation will be concealed by means of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes that contain the medication code assigned. The envelopes have to be opened sequentially and only after the participant's name is written on the appropriate envelope. Four clinical visits are planned in every patient at 0 (recruitment and randomization), 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Information on personal and family history of disease, clinical examination (including office BP determination), ABPM and blood and urine samples will be obtained on visits 0. The variables measured in the blood and urine samples depend on the criterium of the attending physician. For this trial, only HbA1c, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria are mandatory. All this information, except personal and family history of disease, will also be collected at week 12. Thirty days after the end of the medication (visit of week 12) all participants will be contacted by telephone to assess safety. For the initial laboratory data required in the CRF, data obtained in primary care in the previous 3 months could be valid. These data will be repeated at the end of the study. Informed consents for the study will be signed by the patients before coming to the hospital. Blood samples extractions included in this protocol will be done, handled and analyzed at each clinical setting according to usual clinical practice. No blood sample storage will be needed in this study. ABPM will be measured using Mobil‐o‐Graph that will give us 24 hours brachial and central BP as well as pulse wave velocity and heart rate. As diary of activity of the patient will not be recorded, in this study, nocturnal (or nighttime) blood pressure refers to measurements within the period from 12.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been reported to be associated with reductions in office blood pressure of 4‐8 mmHg, reductions that could be even higher with the use of ambulatory BP monitoring.15 Accepting an alpha error of 0.05 in a two‐sided test, 150 patients are needed in the active treatment group and 75 in the placebo group (2:1 randomization) to have an 80% power (beta error=0.2) to detect as statistically significant a difference greater than or equal to 5 mmHg in mean nocturnal BP between placebo and active treatment (conservative estimate of the expected effect). The standard deviation is assumed to be 12 mmHg and it is expected a drop‐out rate of 9%. In the prespecifiedsubgroup analysis by albuminuria levels, this sample size (75 in active treatment and 37 in placebo) allows to detect as statistically significant, within each albuminuria stratum and with the same asumptions and alfa and beta errors, a difference greater than or equal to 7,1 mmHg in the reduction of mean nocturnal BP between both groups (active treatment and placebo), an effect still within what can be expected. To respond to secondary objectives, the same analyses will be done for each stratum of albuminuria at randomization. Only patients that complete the 3‐month follow‐up will be analyzed. Patients who do not complete the follow‐up will be compared to those who adhere to the protocol. No interim analysis is planned. A p value<0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. END OF THE TRIAL: DATA MANAGEMENT: Data will be collected in an electronic CRF by participating doctors and nurses both at the hypertension units and at primary care centers. A range of acceptable values and logical rules among variables will be implemented to improve quality of data and reduce the need of queries. PLAN OF ANALYSIS: The main analysiswill compare baseline and final visit values of nocturnal blood pressure and all the rest of quantitative variables of interest within each stratum of albuminuria by means of paired t‐test. Changes of nighttime blood pressure from baseline to final visit among patients with high and very high albuminuria levels will be compared to placebo with t‐test. Variables will be described by means of mean (and standard deviation) or proportion depending on the type of variable considered. Whenever the test of hypothesis may involve discrete variables, chi‐squared testwill be used. Comparability of treatment and placebo groups will be tested (t‐student or chi‐squared test, depending on the variable) to assess randomization, and linear regression will be used to adjust for potential confounders, if needed; stratum of albuminuria at randomization will be forced in the model. The trial will end with the last visit of the last patient recruited. The study may be terminated if the study procedures are not being performed according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The promotor also may terminate the entire study prematurely if concerns for safety arise within this study or in any other study with dapagliflozin. ETHICAL ISSUES: At the recruitment visit, all patients meeting criteria and invited to participate will receive adequate written information on the study and will have the opportunity to ask the investigator any question regarding their participation and will be given enough time to make a decision. Following all this, they will sign and date their acceptance to participate in it prior to randomization.
