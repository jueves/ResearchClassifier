0,0,CN-02270159,"NCT04874116,",Decreasing Cardiovascular Risk for Patients With Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04874116,2021,"Study design and overview: The investigators will conduct this study with 17 teams in 12 clinics that serve low‐income patients: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC's). The goal of the study is to evaluate how well the approach to improving patient outcomes with a blend of communication strategies works in real‐world settings compared to mobile phone texting alone. Each team will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Intervention (Group 1): includes a patient group meeting + a checklist used during each medical visit (together called Office‐GAP) along with text messaging in between visits; the Control (Group 2) includes only the text messages. Randomization: The investigators will recruit 22 diabetes (DM) patients per team. All patients at a particular team will participate in the same group (intervention or control). The investigators chose this approach because it is realistic for providers and patients at a team to follow a similar approach. This also helps the comparison of control and intervention groups to be more accurate because there is less chance of mixing between the two groups. In Michigan, FQHCs have similar numbers and types of providers (internal and family medicine) and nurse practitioners. Methods. Setting: Because the investigators are interested in how well the interventions may address disparities in health outcomes for low‐income and minority patients, they are recruited from FQHCs who serve these populations in Michigan. FQHC patients are mainly below federal poverty levels (92% of participants); 56% are non‐white; 91% are uninsured or covered by Medicaid. Sample: A total of 378 patients, men and women, with Type II diabetes that is not well‐controlled (the standard will be a score for the HbA1c test equal to or higher than 8) will be recruited. In the investigators' pilot studies, 80% of patients who met these criteria agreed to participate. In the pilot, about 10% dropped out before follow‐up at 3 months and a further 3% dropped out before completion. A 20% dropout rate is anticipated. Recruiting 378 patients will result in 320 patients retained by the end of the 5 year study. Based on the pilot study and feedback from clinics, it is estimated that the enrollment goal will be reached within 4 years. Each FQHC will have at least 200 DM patients who meet the criteria. Patient Intervention procedures: Patients will participate either in the intervention group (Office‐GAP + Texting) or in the control group (Texting only) as described below. All patients will receive medical treatment‐as‐usual from the participating clinics, consisting of diabetes care, usual preventive care, and other medical treatment as needed. Office‐GAP Intervention (Patient Activation Intervention): The investigators have described the Office‐GAP intervention in previous peer‐reviewed publications (1‐3). Briefly, after recruitment, patients in the Office‐GAP group will attend: 1) one scheduled group visit, (90‐120 min; 4‐6 patients at a time); 2) one follow‐up visit with their providers within one month, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the group visit. At these follow‐up visits, providers will complete the Office‐GAP Checklist, which evaluates medication prescribing behavior. In addition, shared decision‐making (SDM) and goal setting occurs between patient and provider. These follow‐up visits are patients' regularly scheduled visits with their providers and not additional to their usual care. At the group visit: Research Assistants will obtain informed consent/HIPAA authorization from patients after introducing them to the study; Group 1: Office‐GAP + Texting session: the group visit is a Shared Decision Making (SDM) activation session wherein patients learn self‐management behaviors, communication skills, and use of decision support tools (DSTs). They also learn how to use the eCap electronic pill container to monitor medication adherence; learn to use Way to Health Texting service and confirm set up on their mobile phone. Group 2: For the texting only group: participants will learn how to use Way to Health Texting service and confirm set up on their mobile phone, and learn how to use the eCap electronic pill container to monitor medication adherence. They will not experience the Office‐GAP intervention. Both groups will also complete baseline study questionnaires during the group visit. Office‐GAP Follow‐up visit with providers: the Office‐GAP Checklist. The Office‐GAP Checklist is the core tool of the SDM intervention. A one‐page checklist, this SDM tool outlines all evidence‐based medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in T2DM patients. It is an in‐consultation decision support tool that helps engage the patient and provider to encourage and enhance an SDM process via discussion of medication and secondary prevention/lifestyle changes during an office visit. In this study, the Office‐GAP Checklist will be completed by the provider with direct patient involvement during the office visits at 0‐1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Only Group 1 patients will use this checklist during their office visits. The Office‐GAP Checklist also serves as a provider reminder at the point of care, because the provider records a check‐mark for each medication: ""Yes"" (if patient is on the medication), ""No"" (if patient is not), or ""Does not apply to me because…"" A reason for exclusion of a medication is also provided (patient is not eligible for the medication, has a contraindication to its use, or the patient and provider have identified an alternative due to side effect or cost concerns). Details about the next appointment and any secondary prevention plan changes are also listed on the form. At the end of the visit, both patient and provider sign the form to confirm that they have reviewed the checklist. The patient receives a copy of the checklist to take home and a copy is retained in the patient record. All providers in the intervention teams receive a brief provider education in Office‐GAP tool use and communication skills (described below C.4.15). Educational tool literacy standards. Office‐GAP has been rigorously adapted for use with low health literacy patients. All study materials are grade 6 reading level. Mobile DM self‐management texting intervention (Way to Health Texting Program). During group visits, all patients in both groups will be taught how to send and receive text messages on their phone. The Way to Health service does not require patients to use a special app. Way to Health engages patients in two ways: 1) Patients receive daily Way to Health messages appropriate to their diagnosis and medications (e.g. BP, blood glucose, medication) and appointment reminders throughout the study. They also receive informational and educational texts. 2) Patients respond to prompts, and may contact their providers' office throughout the study via texting. Patients will receive additional diabetic modules that follow the standard for diabetes education for the rest of the 12 months once the initial 15 week program is complete. The Way to Health texting program will be used to encourage T2DM patients to maintain communication with their providers, improve medication adherence, and other secondary prevention and self‐care between visits. Daily messages may take the form of reminders, prompts, education, or reinforcement. Sample message texts include ""Did you take your medications today?"" and ""How many times did you check your feet for wounds this week?"" The pilot found the program to be usable and effective for both patients and providers. Provider and Practice Staff Training. All intervention providers will participate in an interactive orientation which has been shown to promote behavioral change among health professionals. Providers will be asked to agree to participate in the study before the session. Provider/Staff Educational module: The training session is 90 minutes long. The session is scheduled at multiple times to meet providers' needs. In the pilot Office‐GAP study, there was 100% participation by providers. The training module, delivered by the PI and Dr. Karen Kelly‐Blake, includes: 1) brief presentations on effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of medical therapy and behavior changes in management of T2DM, blood pressure, and heart disease; 2) a hands‐on practice session for providers to elicit patients' preferences and values; 3) an introduction to the Office‐GAP Checklist and best practices for using it during a patient encounter; 4) review of the Smith evidence‐based patient‐centered method for establishing trust, communicating clearly, and engaging in goal‐setting with patients. Providers will have a chance to practice skills using Braddock and Elwyn's approach to role‐playing to model office visits; and 5) a complete pre‐and post‐training survey (before and after the training session) to determine provider attitudes about the use of DSTs, SDM, and mHealth in their practice and an end of study semi‐structured interview. The investigators are highly experienced in provider training. Analysis of outcomes: The primary outcome (medication adherence ‐ how well patients adhere to their providers' advice to take medications) will be assessed in each individual patient by e‐CAP monitoring, a device that signals when patients open their prescription medication bottles. The investigators will conduct preliminary analysis of study hypotheses at 6mo and 12mo using standard statistical tests. A comparison of Office‐GAP plus Way to Health teams (Group 1) to Way to Health only teams (Group 2) at baseline will be conducted to be sure the patient populations are similar in terms of health characteristics that may influence the results. If substantive differences are found, the investigators will be able to control for these in subsequent analyses using statistical regression techniques. This method assures a degree of dissimilarity rather than assuming all of the clinical populations are identical. Equivalence between the groups will be assessed based on demographic factors such as age, gender, education, race/ethnicity.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04874116,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02270159/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False
1,1,CN-01560569,"NCT02990299,",mHealth for Diabetes Adherence Support,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02990299,2016,"Many African‐Americans and Latinos with diabetes do not achieve recommended diabetes goals placing them at high risk for complications. Team‐based models of care can help in reaching goals of therapy. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth) technologies can further improve outcomes among those more difficult to reach. This study will evaluate the impact of a team‐based, mHealth intervention designed to improve medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors. The investigators will compare this mHealth approach with usual care. Clinical pharmacists and health coaches (HC) will deliver our proposed team‐based intervention. mHealth delivery includes mobile phone text messaging, secure videoconferencing, and HC home visits. Pharmacists will focus on medication reconciliation and adherence. Health coaches will help identify psychosocial and environmental challenges to adherence in a culturally‐sensitive manner. Together, they can assist in goal‐setting, problem‐solving, negotiation of competing priorities, and provide social support leveraging mHealth technologies. Preliminary data from previous research by the research team supports the role of health coaches partnering with clinic‐ based pharmacists in improving diabetes outcomes in minorities. In the proposed mHealth intervention, patient‐ pharmacist videoconferencing will eliminate the need for in‐person visits with a pharmacist, which is impractical for many low‐income patients. In addition, pilot work suggests that text messaging is a preferable means of communication and may facilitate more frequent contact with patients. This is a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches. The research team will randomize 220 patients through UI Health to either: (1) mHealth diabetes adherence support through clinical pharmacists and health coaches; or (2) usual care. After one year, patients completing the mHealth intervention will be monitored for an additional year while the usual care group receives the mHealth approach. Outcomes include medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and LDL‐cholesterol levels. The specific aims include: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches to African‐American and Latino adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes; (2) evaluate the maintenance of improved diabetes behaviors as well as clinical outcomes one year after completing the intervention; (3) evaluate the cost and cost‐effectiveness of mHealth diabetes adherence support compared to usual care; and (4) evaluate the reach, adoption, and implementation of mHealth diabetes adherence support based on the RE‐AIM framework.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02990299,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01560569/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False
2,2,CN-02269543,"NCT04847778,",Assess the Impact of Insulclock on Glycemic Variability and Treatment Compliance in Uncontrolled DM1 Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04847778,2021,"Study design: This multicentric randomized open‐label study will be conducted at the Hospital General de Segovia (Segovia, Spain), Hospital de Cruces (Bilbao, Spain), Hospital Arquitecto Marcide (Ferrol, A Coruña, Spain) and Hospital Central de Asturias (Oviedo, Spain) after classification by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) and ethical approval by the Ethics Review Committee of each research center. The study will be conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each participant will provide written informed consent before being included in the study. The study is scheduled across seven visits. At Visit 1 (Screening, Week ‐1), demographic and clinical information will be collected, and concomitant medications will be registered. All potential study patients will be screened for eligibility after signing the informed consent form (ICF) and will be assigned with a patient identification number. Laboratory evaluations (HbA1c, serum chemistry) must be available within the last 2 months. An identification number will be assigned to each participant At Visit 2 (Run‐in, week 0), participants will receive information on the use of the Insulclock device and app on masked mode (excluding the use of Insulclock 360 app information and alarms). If the participant does not use a CGM: a healthcare professional applies the FreeStyle Libre sensor to the back of the upper arm and activates it. If the participant already uses a CGM system, the patient will be encouraged to use sensors during this period. At Visit 3 (First Visit CGM 1, week 1) and Visit 4 (Follow‐up, week 3), participants will be encouraged to use the system At Visit 5 (Visit Starting CGM 2 and Randomization, week 4) participants will be randomized (1:1) to the Active Insulclock group or the Masked Insulclock group. Participants randomized in the Insulclock Active Group will receive detailed instructions on using the Insulclock device and Insulclock 360 mobile application and will be instructed and motivated for full use of all system functions (alarms, messages to the caregivers and investigation team). Participants randomized in the Insulclock Masked Group will be instructed on the correct installation and use of the Insulclock system for recording insulin bolus information but they will not receive any other information and will not have access to the Insulclock 360 application from the Internet and will keep administering insulin treatment as before. A healthcare professional will apply a FreeStyle Libre sensor to the upper arm in all the participants who do not use a CGM and will be encouraged to wear the sensor for 2 weeks. Participants who already use a CGM system will be encouraged to use sensors during this period. At Visit 6 (Final Visit CGM 2 and Randomization, week 6). Participants will receive a reminder on the use of Insulclock according to the corresponding group. At Visit 7 (Final Visit, week 7) the mobile application diaries will be collected and reviewed. Participants will receive to fill in the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) and the Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (DTSQ). Study population Investigators will include 80 participants aged 18‐80 years with uncontrolled T1DM who provide written informed consent. Persistent uncontrolled T1DM was defined as HbA1C levels ≥6.5% for at least 1 year, and/or variations ≥1% in HbA1C within the previous 2 years and attending regular (more than 2 per year) follow‐up visits at the Endocrinology department. Investigators will exclude pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with a history of or current alcohol or drug abuse, acute infection, cognitive decline or dementia, or any illness or condition that could interfere with the trial. Study devices: Insulclock is a small electronic device that works as an add‐on module of insulin pens. This device can record the dose and time of insulin injected, register temperature changes of insulin pens, record the duration of an injection, and the specific insulin pen used. In the present study, participants self‐administer insulin with pens coupled to Insulclock and according to routine clinical practice. By means of acoustic and visual alarms, participants receive information for a correct injection technique (an alert if the injection time was <6 seconds) or to prevent stacking insulin (an alert if a previous injection was done within the 2 previous hours). The Insulclock device is synchronized with the Insulclock 360 app for the automatic logging of patient data. The Insulclock 360 app also has a reminder function to promote the timely administration of insulin doses. Users can also receive customized tips on DM management with the ""my tutors"" tool and obtain information on DM topics. Insulclock 360 app is compatible with Apple and Android operating systems. In the Active group, participants will receive acoustic and visual alarms, device‐related information and will have access to the Insulclock 360 app. In the Masked group, participants know the dose, time and duration of injections, but these participants will not receive any reminder and will be masked to the Insulclock 360 app. Participants will use the Freestyle Libre (Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, Oxon, UK) for the continuous monitoring of glucose levels. This flash continuous monitoring system is to be worn on the upper arm and does not require capillary glucose concentrations for calibration. The sensor automatically records glucose data every 15 minutes for 14 days. Statistical Analysis The proposed statistical analysis methods constitute a synthesis of the methods to be used in this study to apply them to the data collected and respond to the general objective and the specific objectives. Data from all participants included in the study, who meet the selection criteria, will be analyzed. Data in absentia will not be charged and will be considered as lost. A general description of the variables included in the study will be made. The absolute and relative frequency distributions of the qualitative variables will be presented by investigators, as well as the measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) of the quantitative variables. The confidence intervals will be presented at 95% for the main quantitative outcome variables associated with the main objective and the main secondary variables. The data corresponding to the variables included in the main objective will be descriptively analyzed. Investigators will use the SPSS software Version 17.0. to perform the analysis. The hypothesis tests that are carried out will be in all bilateral cases and with a significance level of 0.05. For variables that do not fit the normal distribution(or parametric), the Mann Whitney hypothesis tests will be used (for unpaired data). The chi‐square test (or Fischer's exact test when appropriate) will be used for the analysis of contingency tables as well as for the comparison of proportions and/or frequency distributions.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04847778,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02269543/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Later, the research assistant will telephone the eligible patients to schedule a first visit to their homes for enrollment. Intervention: The participants randomized to the intervention group will be given a tablet‐based, interactive touch‐screen self‐monitoring system free of charge to perform disease self‐monitoring in their homes. The objectives of the system are to empower patients' ability to self‐monitor and improve their self‐care adherence and medication compliance by enabling access to various e‐support, information, resources, and self‐monitoring tools in a timely manner. It runs on a 10‐inch touch‐screen tablet computer that is programmed to connect to a 2‐in‐1 blood pressure and glucose monitor. Measurement modules are available for assessing and recording blood pressure, pulse, and blood glucose level. The assessment records are fully automated and can be retrieved and reviewed in structured tables and charts. Patients can determine whether assessment values that deviate from the critical levels may need attention based on the ""normal value ranges"" indicated by the system. The system also has a module that provides both text‐ and video‐based learning resources related to the causes and prevention of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, self‐care, salt and sodium intake, diet, action plan (e.g., appropriate actions in response to symptoms), exercise, and stress management. The care information and video capability allow patients to easily learn how to self‐monitor and self‐manage. In addition, the system has a reminder function that can be programmed to emit audible reminders at predetermined times alerting patients to take their prescribed medications. A secured web portal (http://selfcare.imse.hku.hk/) is available for authorized, non‐patient users such as caregivers and families to remotely review and monitor the assessment values of key patient health signs using their own mobile devices or computers. Randomization: Participants will be stratified into four groups based on the HbA1c and systolic blood pressure measurements: (i) HbA1c ≤ 8% and systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg, (ii) HbA1c ≤ 8% and systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, (iii) HbA1c > 8% and systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg, and (iv) HbA1c > 8% and systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg. These cut‐offs for grouping were set based on previous studies (2, 3) and clinical judgement. Within each stratum, the patients will be block‐randomized into the study groups using randomly permuted blocks and sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The randomization and allocation process will be based on the practical guide for permuted blocks randomization in a stratified trial, as described in Doig and Simpson (4), and handled centrally by a researcher in response to a telephone call.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02799953,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Hypertension",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01559001/full,Hypertension,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Diabetes distress, a negative response to the diagnosis of T2DM, danger of complications, and self‐management burdens is present in up to 70% of persons with T2DM. Distress is a significant factor in medication nonadherence and poor glycemic control. Treatment adherence is vital to maintain glucose control and reduce complications. The literature has identified dysfunctional thinking patterns such as beliefs (e.g., I can't handle taking these medications), assumptions (e.g., I know I will have side effects to these medications) and interpretations (e.g., I'm too overwhelmed to do all of this stuff) as critical variables that impact both distress and T2DM treatment adherence. Current treatment strategies within primary care do not address the dysfunctional thinking patterns that affect the patient's distress level, T2DM medication adherence, and complex daily self‐care activities. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), a well‐established evidenced‐based treatment, helps patients to identify, and restructure dysfunctional thinking patterns. The investigators propose to test a brief phone CBT approach that is supported by a comprehensive mobile phone CBT skills practice application (app) within primary care. The promising results of the investigators preliminary studies using a mobile phone app to stimulate real‐time CBT skills practice prompt us to propose a pilot of its use with patients with T2DM with the following aims: Primary aim: examine feasibility and acceptability of the assessment protocol, and the recruitment, and retention of study participants. Secondary aim: 1) collect preliminary data on the effect of the intervention on clinical outcomes, e.g., self‐reported adherence to medication and self‐management adherence, e.g., diet, exercise; levels of diabetes distress, diabetes medication beliefs, and distal T2DM outcomes (HbA1c level and body mass index).",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02081586,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01544161/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

METHODS: Patients with diabetes and depression were randomized to pharmacist‐led or nurse‐led telehealth. Veterans with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, an A1C ≥ 7.5%, diagnosis of depression, and access to a landline phone were invited to participate. Patients were randomized to usual care of nurse‐led telehealth or pharmacist‐led telehealth. Patients were shown how to use the telehealth equipment by the nurse or pharmacist. In the pharmacist‐led group, the patients received an in‐depth medication review in addition to the instruction on the telehealth equipment. RESULTS: After six months, the pharmacist‐led telehealth arm showed significant improvements for cardiovascular medication adherence (14.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 27.6), antidepressant medication adherence (26.0; 95% CI 0.9 to 51.2), and overall medication adherence combined (13.9; 95% CI 6.6 to 21.2) from baseline to six‐month follow‐up. There was a significant difference in A1C between each group at the six‐month follow‐up in the nurse‐led telehealth group (6.9 ± 0.9) as compared to the pharmacist‐led telehealth group (8.8 ± 2.0). There was no significance in the change in patient health questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‐D) from baseline to follow‐up in both groups.

A 2x2 factorial experiment is NOT a 4‐arm trial in which each condition is compared in turn to a control condition. In fact, factorial designs do not require a larger number of participants than other designs (e.g., Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)) and when used to address suitable research questions, they require fewer participants than other designs. Adding factors does not require a dramatic increase in sample size to maintain power. H1: There will be a main effect of Personalized Adherence Intervention on percentage of A1C, time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence behaviors, and biological markers of complications. H2: There will be a main effect of Personalized Behavioral Health Intervention on percentage of A1C, time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence behaviors, and biological markers of complications. AIM 2: PHASE 2: Determine effectiveness of the intervention components on maintenance of A1C, percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence, and biological markers improvements throughout 6‐month follow‐up. H1: Participants who are randomized to T1D medical appointments every 6 weeks will show better improvements in gains in A1C, percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence, and biological markers compared to those participants who revert to medical appointments occurring every 3 months.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT03324438,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01565237/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Our recent trial found that a digital intervention was effective at improving medication adherence in non‐adherent patients with Hypertension or Type 2 Diabetes; but we do not know how it brought about behavioural changes. This research is a post‐trial process evaluation of the mechanism by which the intervention achieved its intended effects. Methods: A mixed methods design with quantitative and qualitative evidence synthesis was employed. Data was generated by two studies. Study 1 used questionnaires to measure the underlying mechanisms of and the medication adherence behaviour, and digital logfiles to objectively capture intervention effects on the process of behaviour change. Multilevel regression analysis on 57 complete intervention group cases tested the effects of the intervention at modifying the mechanism of behaviour change and in turn at improving medication adherence. Study 2 used in depth interviews with a subsample of 20 intervention patients, and eight practise nurses. Thematic analysis provided evidence about the overarching intervention functions and recommendations to improve intervention reach and impact in primary care. Results: Study 1 found that intervention effectiveness was significantly associated with positive changes in the underlying mechanisms of behaviour change (R2 = 0.26, SE = 0.98, P = 0.00); and this effect was heightened twofold when the tailored intervention content and reporting on medication taking (R2 = 0.59, SE = 0.74, P = 0.00) was interested into the regression model. Study 2 suggested that the intervention supported motivation and ability to adherence, although clinically meaningful effects would require very brief medication adherence risk appraisal and signposting to ongoing digitally delivered behavioural support during clinical consultations. Conclusion: This post trial process evaluation used objective methods to capture the intervention effect on the mechanisms of behaviour change to explain intervention effectiveness, and subjective accounts to explore the circumstances under which these effects were achieved. The results of this process evaluation will inform a large scale randomised controlled trial in primary care.",9,,806168,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 34988058,EMBASE 637002350,,,,Journal article,"*behavior change; *hypertension; *medication compliance; *non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; *primary medical care; Adult; Article; Clinical article; Comparative effectiveness; Consultation; Controlled study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy]; Female; Human; Humans; Hypertension; Interview; Male; Medication Adherence; Motivation; Nurse; Primary Health Care; Quantitative analysis; Questionnaire; Randomized controlled trial; Surveys and Questionnaires; Synthesis; Thematic analysis",10.3389/fpubh.2021.806168,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02362090/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Patients will be randomly assigned to the immediate intervention group or 4‐month waitlist control group. The former will immediately join the tablet computer courses, while the later will wait for four (4) months before starting their courses. The follow‐up period for patients will be one (1) year after the start of courses. Patient assessments will include baseline and follow‐up assessments of health behaviors, functional status, health conditions, and social interactions and engagements, plus technology use and acceptance. Baseline assessment will be conducted at recruitment for all patients, and for waitlist control group again at the beginning of the course. Follow‐up assessments will be conducted at four (4) months, eight (8) months, and twelve (12) months after the start date of the courses. Young volunteers will also be assessed to understand their experiences in the volunteering services and any impact from this experience. The assessments will be conducted at the baseline, during the courses, and two (2) months and four (4) months after the beginning of the courses. In addition, a group of 140 young adults will be recruited from universities to serve as the comparison group and will be asked to complete the assessment survey at baseline, two (2) months, and four (4) months later. For older adults: Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be referred by doctors in the metabolism and endocrinology department of the two hospitals to recruiters and will be randomly assigned to immediate intervention group and waitlist control group. The aim of the comparison is to assess the potential effects of mobile technology program with intergenerational interaction on patients' technology use, self‐efficacy, self‐management behavior, and social engagement, and whether it results in less social isolation and health care utilization, improved health and mental health status, and greater quality of life. Recruitment procedure: 1. Tzu Chi diabetes health educators will recruit patients with type 2 diabetes and screen them for eligibility. The health educators will complete a patient contact card for each patient that they screen for eligibility. If eligible, the health educators will explain the study to the patients and ask for their interest to participate. Interested patients will be referred to an IMTOP study recruiter. The recruiter will collect all patient contact cards and completed screeners from the health educators. 2. The study recruiters on site in the hospital will obtain the informed consent from the eligible and interested patients. When the patients sign the study consent, the recruiter will write on the patient contact card the patient ID next to Study Participation Status ‐ Enrolled, and complete the patient contact card. 3. The recruiter will then conduct the baseline interview. Baseline interview can be done face to face or via telephone if patient prefers. 4. Patient's study group (immediate intervention or wait list control group) will be randomly assigned at the study's Qualtrics database after baseline interview is complete. 5. All recruitment paper, if any, will be sent to the project manager to file on a locked cabinet. 6. The patients who are randomized to the immediate intervention group will be assigned to the training course as soon as a course is available. The patients randomized to the waitlist control group will need to wait for six months to serve as no intervention control, and then assigned to the training course. Description of intervention: The intervention is a 12‐week program which consists of 8‐week training sessions followed by 4‐week consultation service for technical support. Both will be provided by the young volunteers. The themes of the 8‐week training session are designed based on the objectives of IMTOP: 1) teach skills of tablet use, 2) introduce online community communication to decrease social isolation and obtain social support from family and friends, young volunteers, health care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease), 3) teach diabetes self‐management knowledge and skills based on the evidence‐based Chronic Disease Self‐Management Program; and 4) teach mobile technology application to healthcare access and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e‐newspaper, e‐books, related sites, apps). Moreover, the enrolled older adults will be invited to use a diabetes self‐management behavior tracking app developed by the research team. The app is designed to encourage diabetes patients to regularly record their diet, physical activity, water consumption, medication adherence, blood sugar readings, and blood pressure readings. The data will be used for our research analysis to understand to what extent the older adults use the app and whether regular recording has impact on the outcome measures. The 4‐week consultation service post the 8‐week training course is intended as additional support for the older adults who encounter technical issues when using the tablet on their own. To receive the technical support, the older adults shall call the study hotline or post their questions on the study website to explain the technical issues. The research staff will find a study volunteer to address the technical issues. During the training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to 90‐min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the taping/photo shooting. Accrual and baseline data collection: University of Southern California (USC) research team will prepare enrollment packages (including an information sheet, the screener, the patient contact card, the consent form, HIPPA form and a 40‐minute baseline survey). Health educators employed by two Tzu Chi Hospitals will help enroll and consent eligible patients. Participating patients will be asked to sign the HIPPA authorization form to release their medical records in hospitals. Consenting patients will be invited to take baseline survey through an interview with a study interviewer, either in‐person or by phone based on patient's preference. When baseline survey is completed, patients will be randomly assigned to intervention group and wait‐list control group. Follow‐up survey: For immediate intervention patients, 4‐month, 8‐month, and 12‐month follow‐up surveys will be administered via telephone by part‐time interviewers employed for the study by the hospitals. For wait‐list control group patients, 4‐month, 8‐month, 12‐month, and 16‐month follow‐up surveys will be administered via telephone by the part‐time interviewers. Study data will be obtained from patients' self‐report on study assessments, study tracking records such as the training course attendance, and patients' medical records pertaining to diabetes care and healthcare utilizations in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals. Self‐report data collected from patients include demographic characteristics, physical health and mental health status, self‐management behaviors, health care utilization, health literacy, self‐efficacy, social engagement, and quality of life. The study assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes. For young volunteers: Accrual and baseline data collection: IMTOP research staff and employees (such as diabetes health educators) of the Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals will distribute young volunteer recruitment flyers to officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities nearby the study sties. The IMTOP research staff will also arrange meetings at university campuses to introduce the study and call for volunteers. The study information and the call for volunteers will be disseminated campus wide two months prior to each IMTOP training term starts. Young adults who are interested in participating in the study as volunteer instructors for the training course will sign up at the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The sign‐up section of the website will explicitly show the language that enrollment in the study means a volunteer is not only serving as an instructor but also as a research participant. To complete the sign up will require acknowledgment of the dual roles. There will be a study hotline number shown on the recruitment flyer for interested young adults to get more information about the study and for sign‐up. The research staff will contact those young adults who meet the study inclusion criteria for an interview to clarify the job responsibilities and the expectations. Those who agree to meet the expectations will be invited to attend the two‐day training workshop (described below). On the day of the training workshop, the young adults will be asked to consent for their study participation and to complete the study baseline. Then they will be accepted for the study enrollment as young volunteers. The target recruitment is 140 volunteers. USC research team will prepare the enrollment package (including the recruitment flyer, the sign‐up form, the consent form, and a 40‐minute self‐administered baseline survey). The sign‐up and the consent form will be available via the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The self‐administered surveys will be available on qualtrics website via a web link in the study website. Orientation workshop: USC research team will provide two orientation workshops for enrolled volunteers to learn skills and knowledge for delivering the intervention service. The topics of orientation workshops include young volunteers' role and responsibilities in the IMTOP research project, knowledge of aging process, motivational interviewing skills, problem solving skills, empathy, communication with older adults, and introduction of the 8‐week training curriculum and the 4‐week technical support. Volunteering services: After the orientation workshop is successfully completed, young volunteers will be assigned to be one of about 4 instructing volunteers to provide the tablet training for a group of approximately 10 older adults with type 2 diabetes. The training course is 2 hours per session and 1 session per week for 8 weeks long. In each session, there is a prepared course material for the volunteers to deliver to the older adults, such as use of web browsers, application of social media, and online supporting materials for the older adults to learn mobile technology for their self‐management to improve health and quality of life. After the 8‐week training period, the young volunteers will provide 4‐week technical support for the diabetes outpatients via phone or mobile device. During the tablet training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to 120‐min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the taping/photo shooting. Baseline and follow‐up survey: The enrolled young volunteers will be asked to complete the self‐administered online surveys at baseline and at 2‐month and 4‐month follow up. That is, the baseline will be completed prior to the intervention. The 2‐month follow‐up will be completed immediately after the 8‐week training course. The 4‐month follow‐up will be completed one month after the 4‐week technical support period. The survey will collect data about demographic characteristics, level of empathy, citizenship behavior, time management skills, altruism value, purpose of life, and career development. In addition, the young volunteers will be asked to take turn in recording the class log, including the class attendance, materials taught, Q&A, any difficulty or questions in delivering the curriculum, and other relevant observations or issues. Additionally, once a month for a total of three times, once in week 4 and once in week 8 during the 8‐week course, plus once in the end of the 4‐week technical support, they will be asked to write a short reflection of their volunteering experience. These study assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes. For young adult comparison group: A group of 140 young adults similar to the young volunteers will be recruited from universities through information meetings held by the research staff in collaboration with officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities. They will not be randomized, but instead they will be deliberately recruited to be the comparison group that matches with the young volunteer group on the bases of age range, college attendance and major, and location of the schools. These young adults will be informed to serve as the comparison group for the study. Once consented, they will be directed to answer the same self‐administered online surveys at baseline and at 2‐month and 4‐month follow up. Data Storage and Confidentiality: 1. All questionnaires completed electronically via the web‐based survey company qualtrics, license available through the USC Information Technology Services (http://www.usc.edu/its/qualtrics/), will be kept in the secure website of qualtrics and then downloaded into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work.

RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT Potential Risks: There are no anticipated risks to subjects' participation in this study. The tablet training program takes place in Taipei or Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital. Subjects' participation in the program may involve normal risks in transportation to attend the training sessions. Frequency and intensity of training sessions might cause them certain level of anxiety and discomfort, such as soreness in eye. As the study subjects will also participate in the study surveys, some of the survey questions may make them uncomfortable or concerned, but they can choose not to answer any questions they do not wish to answer. Participating in research may involve a loss of privacy, but all of the information the subjects provide will be kept confidential. The possibility of a breach of privacy to occur is very low but will exist as long as we hold the data. All participants will be advised that they are free not to use the technology and not to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable. However, in previous studies of depressed patients, distress resulting from interviews and questionnaires has been minimal. Subjects may experience inconvenience and time costs associated with using technology and completing study interviews; however, all interventions and interviews are completely voluntary and will be conducted at the participant' convenience. The technology intervention does not expose patients to additional or unusual medications or side effects. Although all efforts will be made to protect patient confidentiality, those patients who experience critical clinical events (e.g., hypoglycemia) during the study training sessions or those who are likely victims of abuse may experience loss of confidentiality as study staff will be required to report these events to the subject's physician for appropriate safety measures to be taken. Risk Classification: The risks of this study are consistent with the HHS/FDA Regulations definition of minimal risk. Protection Against Risks: The study PIs and the project manger who has a gerontology and public health background will train the study recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers to handle distressed or potentially at risk patients during recruitment, intervention, and assessment. The recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will request permission from distressed subjects to notify their physician so that they may be assessed and treated as necessary. In the case of emergengy, the recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will inform the patient of the immediate need to notify the patient's physician, even without his or her permission, so that these providers may take appropriate action to ensure patient safety. This will involve using usual clinic channels to have the patient urgently evaluated and and appropriate disposition arranged (including possible transport to Emergency Department in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals). The study principal investigator in the local site will be available by cellular phone and will also be notified of emergency patients in order to to ensure timely assessment and treatment by a physician. Data Safety Monitoring Plan: All assessment data will be entered into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. Study patients will be identified by a unique study code number, the identity of which will be known only to the study personnel with direct responsibility for providing patient data. The database will be password protected against non‐project personnel and backed up weekly. This removes patient‐identifiable data from the files. The data manager and biostatistician will create a series of databases in Excel and SAS, so that they can analyze the initial data as it comes in to ensure proper patient recruitment, track progress of the study, and perform data checks and cleaning. All baseline and follow‐up data, including responses to the screener questionnaire, will be entered on qualtrics web‐based survey system through tablets or other computer devices onsite. The data will be identified by the patient's study ID code. This data will be transmitted either wirelessly, through third or forth generation mobile telecommunications, or through the local network connection in real time to the qualtrics server as data is entered by recruiters on the computer devices, which has been loaded with the requisite software and encryption system. The transmitted data will be encrypted using HIPAA‐compliant encryption and password protected. If there is poor wireless connection or mobile telecommunication transmission is not possible, recruiters will enter baseline and follow‐up data on paper forms. All forms will be checked for completeness by the qualtric systems or, if paper, by the study coordinator before being sent to the project manager. The project manager will review and double‐check all of the forms to be sure they are completed and readable. For data on paper forms, data will be entered singly using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC) full screen editor (FSEDIT) into SAS database system with back‐up copy and hard copy kept in secure locked file cabinet in the SSW. For data on the qualtrics server, data would be downloaded onto local sites into the SAS database system with back‐up copy password‐protected. Accuracy of data entry will be ensured by an internal program with FSEDIT for range and logic check, and by a comparison between printouts and the handwritten data forms. To assist in monitoring the study, periodic reports will be generated using graphs and tables summarizing the status of subject recruitment and data collection. Missing data will be routinely rectified. SAS will also be used to analyze the data and generate all statistical reports. Data on the qualtrics server and the project website will be destroyed at the end of the study. Potential Benefits to the Subject and/or Society: Direct benefits to patients who participate IMTOP study include learning: 1) skills of tablet use, 2) online community communication with family and friends, young volunteers, health care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease, 3) diabetes self‐management knowledge and skills; and 4) mobile technology application to health access and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e‐newspaper, e‐books, related sites, apps) at no or minimal out‐of‐pocket cost (e.g., transportation cost to attend the training course). There is a potential of improving the flow of communication between these patients and their health educators as well as physicians through using mobile technology. Self‐management knowledge and behaviors will improve among them. Those patients in the waitlist control group may also experience benefits due to the raised levels of awareness of self‐management, and later experience the potential benefits associated with the tablet training intervention. The potential benefit to society is that IMTOP intervention is likely to create an approach to improve self‐management behaviors, health outcomes, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, with improvement in self‐monitoring behavior among older diabetes patients and raised levels of health awareness among young volunteers, medical expenses of diabetes care by the government might decrease, which benefits the society as a whole. Alternatives to Participation: Refusal to participate will not negatively impact older adults' diabetes care or their access to usually available health services. If patients are interested in learning more about diabetes self‐management skills, but do not wish to participate in the study, written educational materials in Chinese will be available. Refusal to participate among young adults, either in the volunteering group or in the comparison group, also will not have any negative impact on the younger adults. They can request to receive a copy of written educational materials in Chinese for future diabetes prevention. Risk/Benefit Relationship: The potential benefits to participants are greater than the risks associated with participation. The physical, psychological, social, and legal risks to patients with type 2 diabetes are minimal. IMTOP study aims to improve their health outcomes and quality of life. In addition, the intergenerational interactions could be a motivator for them to learn the technology to enhance their skills of self‐management, which may result in improved health and decreased cost of medical care as a whole. For young volunteers, the risk is negligible but the focus of intergenerational interactions could potentially improve their communication with and empathy for older adults, increase awareness of self‐care and disease prevention, build health‐focused values of life style, and shape future career choice. For young adults in the comparison group, although both risk and benefit are minimal, they may feel a sense of pride through their contribution to research.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02971241,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01560159/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Objectives: 1) to develop DiabeText, an intervention delivering automated, tailored brief text messages to support diabetes self‐management; 2) to explore the potential impact of DiabeText on self‐management behavior and glycaemic control, and; 3) to examine the feasibility of conducting a future phase III randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of DiabeText. Methods: 3‐month, two‐arm, randomized feasibility trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04738591) with patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 8%). Participants were allocated to the control (usual care) or DiabeText group (usual care + five text messages per week). Outcomes were: recruitment rate; follow‐up rate, missing data; medication adherence; adherence to Mediterranean diet; physical activity; and HbA1c. In addition, after delivering the intervention, we conducted a qualitative study involving 14 semi‐structured interviews with participants allocated to the DiabeText group, to understand their views about the intervention. Results: From 444 screened people, we recruited 207 participants (recruitment rate = 47%), of which 179 completed the post‐intervention interview (follow‐up rate = 86%). We sent 7,355 SMS during the intervention period, of which 99% successfully reached the participants. At post‐intervention, DiabeText was associated with non‐statistically significant (p > 0.05) improvements in adherence to medication (OR = 2.0; 95%CI 1.0 to 4.2), Mediterranean diet (1.7; 0.9 to 3.2), and physical activity (1.7; 0.9 to 3.1). No between‐group differences were observed in mean HbA1c (p = 0.670). The qualitative study indicated that participants perceived DiabeText as a helpful resource because it increased their awareness about the importance of adequate self‐management and the sense of being cared for.

The study population comprises adults who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test above 8% in the past year. All members of the study population are treated at primary care clinics under the auspices of the Utah Beacon Community Program, which aims to improve health through use of health information technology. We will compare outcomes in two groups within this population: patients with DM who enroll in Care4Life (in addition to receiving standard care) to patients with DM who receive standard care from their physician. We will compare these groups both within the clinic and at an aggregated, overall level. This study relies on the use of information and communications technology (ICT) in supporting patient‐empowerment strategies. Features of successful diabetes care programs for improving adherence to standards of care, such as the use of diabetes self‐management education, checklists that mirror guidelines, and automated reminders are well suited to delivery using an interactive mobile health platform. Research Questions This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Care4Life mHealth program by: 1. Evaluating if a short message service via cell phone texting (SMS) protocol will lead to improvements in clinical, utilization and satisfaction outcomes for patients with DM compared to patient who receive standard care. 2. Evaluating if an SMS protocol can be readily adopted by an adult population in both urban and rural areas with a time‐consuming chronic illness. Targeted outcomes include: 1. Improved measures of diabetes control, demonstrated as HbA1c percentage levels ≤ 8%; improved blood pressure (BP) control, demonstrated as BP ≤ 140/90 millimeters mercury (mm Hg); and lower body mass index (BMI) among users of the SMS‐based tool. 2. Improved knowledge of self‐care and disease management practices among adult patients with diabetes treated in Beacon clinics in the Salt Lake Metropolitan Statistical Area (Salt Lake, Tooele, and Summit counties). 3. Dissemination of results and proof of concept with the broader healthcare community in Utah. The mobile centric diabetes support service at the center of our study is Voxiva's Care4Life platform, which is an interactive mobile application designed to educate participants, encourage behavior change and promote adherence to their prescribed DM treatment protocol. It includes a series of SMS‐based tools that have been developed in collaboration with the Instituto Carso de la Salud, located in Mexico. The service sends content relevant to the target participants and their standard treatment protocol. Care4Life delivers an individually tailored diabetes education and management plan based on data that are collected from patients at enrollment and added to the participant's personal health profile. The SMS protocol draws on the experience of a number of interventions that have been independently studied and shown to improve health outcomes. Care4Life functionality consists of the following components: (1) a diabetes diary that can be used to develop a history of glucose levels and trigger alerts and feedback based on the participant's results; (2) health education with content tailored to the participant's health profile; (3) medication adherence reminders and monitoring; (4) medical appointment reminders; (5) a database that allows a participant to record and monitor her/his weight, BMI, blood pressure and laboratory results; and (6) a health portal that allows a participant to review his/her data, obtain advice and guidance based on the information entered, and manage his/her preferences.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT01546844,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01535948/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False
26,26,CN-01547936,"NCT02214017,",Telemedicine Strategy With Home Treatment Save Resources,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02214017,2014,"Chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension, represent a significant burden of disease Chronic diseases also impose huge costs on the health care systems responsible for managing them as well as their significance for those affected. Non‐pharmacological treatment is mandatory for type 2 diabetes patients characterized by central obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and overeating (1). Secondary failure to reach treatment goals despite an extensive National diabetes rehabilitation program in Denmark is often seen (2). Outpatient control shows positive effects on outpatient rehabilitation (3) reducing HbA1c, weight, and blood pressure. However, some patients never accomplish good diabetes regulation and in others regulation deteriorates over time. New approaches are required and need testing to motivate and give feedback to the patients at home. Telemedicine has the capacity to achieve this, where a diabetic nurse may optimize motivation, treatment, and diet through direct feedback adapted to milieu of the patient in accordance with a potential spouse. Good metabolic control is important as diabetes is inevitable a factor for increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy (4). The quality of life and reduction in work ability is affected, thus, life expectancy is shortened by 6‐8 years. Multi‐factorial intervention may delay this (5). The high incidence of the serious implications strengthens the importance of achieving good metabolic control through lifestyle changes. Health education shows reduction in cardiovascular risk factors (6‐8), which often disappears after the end of the intervention (6‐8). Good self‐care and compliance improve the outcome and reduces diabetes complications (9) and we need new tools to achieve higher attendance to the National diabetes program. Telemedicine represents a novel tool of educating and controlling chronic diseases. It reduced HbA1c for five years with in trials designed to test video‐conferencing, clinical data entry and review, web‐based education materials, and monitored chat groups (10). Home telemonitoring was compared with telephone calls reducing the HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes (11) and the technology confer a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0.5 % when applied as add‐on to standard treatment. It was used adjunctively to a broader telemedicine initiative for adults with diabetes. The largest telemedicine study initiated by the Ministry of Health in England (Whole Systems Demonstrator) randomized 3320 patients [12] with heart failure and diabetes to telemedicine care. It showed that the telemedicine intervention as add‐on therapy resulted a statistically significant reduction in mortality from 8.3% versus 4.6%. Similarly, it showed a reduction of number of inpatients and the number of bed days by 11% and 14%, respectively. The patients' health‐related quality of life was unchanged. The savings was less than the additional cost of using telemedicine and overall it cost 15% more per patient. This point at two important factors when applying telemedicine solutions: First, it should preferably replace the standard care and not add‐on and, second, be based on the patient's own computer, tablet or smartphone, all of which will reduce the cost substantially. Telemedicine is available for 98‐99% of all inhabitants in Denmark by broadband, which allows video conference at home. A few randomized trials with this technology are available at present. We aimed at implementing a telemedicine model in our setting and the design and method should evaluate the quality of treatment as well as technical problems and replace the standard treatment. Aim: We compared clinical data from a telemedicine group with a standard care group treated by the same medical algorithm. We wanted to reduce the barriers for the use of a home monitoring and ‐treatment among elderly, type 2 diabetes patients Hypothesis: Treatment by telemedicine or standard care in type 2 diabetes patients results in similar clinical HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids. Materials and methods: Individually visits at the outpatient clinic to plan improvement of glycemic control were made before information of the study was given. Individual goals of the treatment and the drugs needed to fulfil the objectives were agreed on. The patients received the information for the study, and if they wanted to participate, they signed an approval of participation and randomization was performed. All medical treatment, control of blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and education was executed via videotelephone in the telemedicine group In the control group patients attended usual procedure in the outpatient clinic with regular visits. Summary of recommendations for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for the participants were: HbA1c 6.5‐7.5% (48‐58 mmol/L) , fasting blood glucose 6.5‐7.5 mmol/l, diurnal blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, LDL‐cholesterol <100 mg/dL (<2.5 mmol/L) and start of medication with elevated urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ≥30 (μg/mg). The treatment algorithm was lifestyle adjustment plus antidiabetic drugs described elsewhere. When the goals were reached within 3 weeks, the videotelephone was disconnected and patients were encouraged to continue glycemic control at their general practitioner. However, the trial went on with a follow‐up and evaluation after six month according to the 'intention‐to‐treat' principle to see if a difference in the initial care mattered significantly. A videotelephone in the telemedicine group was delivered and serviced by the Danish Tele Company. The trial included type 2 diabetes patients allocated from October 2011 until July 2012 referred to the outpatient clinic from general practitioners. At entry, all patients were screened by albumin/creatinine excretion rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram, lipid profile, diabetic food control, and arteriosclerotic symptoms (angina pectoris, claudication, and fatigue). Diurnal blood pressure was measured by monitors.

27,27,CN-01701961,"NCT03800680,",A Randomized Trial to Slow the Progression of Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03800680,2019,"Technological and economic advancement have created a major challenge to public health agencies in Singapore and other first world countries: the challenge being how to get individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle when that is no longer a requirement for economic prosperity (and in fact may be a hindrance). What is required is a low cost strategy that effectively manages risk factors for chronic disease without overwhelming the public healthcare infrastructure. Although technology and economic advancement are clearly part of the problem, they may also be part of the solution. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), lifestyle modification can be highly effective at stemming the progression of the disease. Effective interventions include modules that teach appropriate strategies for weight management, increased physical activity, better diet, routine glucose monitoring, and strict compliance to prescribed diabetes medications. These components can now be effectively delivered electronically. A recent review and meta‐analysis of 13 smartphone applications for diabetes management found that these applications offered modest benefits, with a mean difference in HbA1c of ‐0.40%. Because of the high costs involved in treating people with chronic conditions, employers, insurers, and governments all have a financial incentive to contain the chronic disease epidemic. Therefore, each has shown a willingness to invest in some level of prevention and treatment efforts. It is our contention that contingent rewards may be necessary to help people overcome their preferences for current over future consumption, often called present bias. Behavioral economists recommend that, to overcome present bias, rewards should be tied to both short‐term and long‐term outcomes or behaviors, such as monitoring blood glucose and taking medications as prescribed (short term) and pre‐defined outcomes such as achieving a target HbA1c level over a specified duration (long term). Based on a recent systematic review of incentive studies conducted by members of our team, an optimal rewards strategy has the potential to greatly increase the effectiveness of existing mobile diabetes applications. If shown to be effective and cost effective, the investigators also believe payers will subsidize such a strategy. Specifically, the investigators propose to conduct a 52‐week, three‐arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether an evidence‐based, low‐cost mobile diabetes management package (DMP), with or without an incentive program grounded in economic theory, can effectively and cost‐effectively improve outcomes for adults with diabetes. The control arm (Arm 1) will receive usual care, whereas participants in the intervention arms will receive the DMP alone (Arm 2) or the DMP with the M‐POWER Rewards incentive program (Arm 3) in addition to their usual care. The investigators hypothesize that participants in Arms 2 and 3 will show improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c levels, at the Month 12 primary endpoint compared to participants in the Arm 1 control group. The investigators also hypothesize that Arm 3 will have improved HbA1c levels compared to Arm 2 at Month 12. Similar hypotheses will be tested for secondary outcomes measured at Month 6. In addition, the investigators will quantify the incremental cost‐effectiveness of DMP with M‐POWER Rewards and the net cost implications of both from a third party payer's perspective. The investigators hypothesize that despite its higher implementation cost, effectiveness will be greater and net cost will be lower for Arm 3 relative to the Arm 1 control group due to the reduction in medical expenditures that result from improved glycaemic control.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT03800680,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01701961/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Sixty six patients were selected using convenient sampling and divided equally into two control and intervention groups based on random allocation. Web‐based education was provided to the intervention group for six months. Data were collected before, at the third month of the intervention, and at the end of the intervention using ""Patient Identification Form"", ""Metabolic Control Variables Form"", ""Diabetes Self‐Care Scale"" and ""Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes"" forms. All the patients were female individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at least a year ago, using insulin between the ages of 18 to 65 years old, who applied to the internal medicine and endocrine outpatient clinic of a training and research hospital in Ankara. Patients had no communication barriers, and they were able to use computers and smartphones and volunteer for this study. No consultancy training was given to the control group by the researcher. They only received routine education in the hospital. Data Collection Tools Data is collected using ""Patient Identification Form"", ""Metabolic Control Variables Form"", ""Diabetes Self‐Care Scale"" and ""Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes"" forms. Patient Identification Form Patient Identification Form was created for this study by scanning the literature. In this form, there were 12 questions in total. The questions included the first letters of the name and surname for coding purposes. There were questions about the age, marital status, employment status, educational status, smoking, alcohol and snacking habits, regular insulin use, blood glucose measurement, physical activity, dietary compliance, and previous educations about diabetes. Metabolic Control Variables Form Metabolic Control Variables Form was created for this study by scanning the literature. It had questions regarding the disease of the individuals. The questions were about fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, weight, height, and body mass index. Diabetes Self‐Care Scale Diabetes Self‐Care Scale is a survey. Diabetes Self‐Care Scale was developed by Lee and Fisher in 2005. It aims to evaluate the self‐care activities of patients with type 2 diabetes. This scale was adapted and translated to Turkish by Karakurt and Kaşıkçı in 2008. The options of the scale were changed to ""Never (1)"" ""Sometimes (2)"" ""Frequently (3)"" and ""Always (4)"". It has been stated that patients who score points more than 66% of the scale total points are assumed at a level to meet their self‐care. Based on the 4‐point Likert type, the maximum score of the scale was 140 points. As the score increases, the self‐care activities of the patients increase positively. Diabetes Self‐Care Scale contains 35 items. The scale does not have sub‐dimensions and inverse expressions. These items aim to get information about eating on time, exercising, measuring and recording blood sugar, using oral antidiabetics and insulin as recommended, visiting a doctor for checking blood sugar, foot care, personal hygiene practices, diabetes, and its complications. While the Cronbach Alpha value of the scale developed by Lee and Fisher was determined to be 0.80, the total Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the scale in Karakurt's research was determined as 0.81. Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes The Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes is a survey. The Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes was prepared by Charlotte Paddison in Japan in 2010 for individuals with type 2 diabetes. It consists of informative questions about the support status of the family and conflicts with the family. The scale was adapted to Turkish by Sofulu and Avdal in 2015 and the Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the scale is 0.740. DFSC has two sub‐dimensions being 'Family Support' and 'Family Conflict'. The highest score obtained from the sub‐dimensions was 50 and the lowest score was 10. As the subscale scores increase, the level of support increases. As the family conflict sub‐dimension score decreases, the family conflict increase. The answers in the scale are 5‐point Likert type and are classified as strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. The scale contains 10 items in total. The items aim to get information to measure the family's attitude towards the diet, exercise, medications, and mental state of the diabetic. Website An educative website was created for our study. The content of the website was accessible from ""www.diyabet.mumcu.net"" and the content of the website was brought together by scanning the literature. The content text was quoted from publicly available information and guides as ADA and IDF. The pictures on the website were obtained from license‐free sources. The website also included a training video that was prepared by the researcher. The website was developed by using Microsoft Asp.NET MVC technology and it was designed responsively for ease of use. The website could be accessed from computers, tablets, and smartphones. Expert opinions were obtained using the DISCERN Measurement Tool to evaluate the reliability and quality of the training material. A username and a password were provided separately for each of the 33 individuals in the intervention group. In addition to the user content, the website had a separate management panel that was only used by the researcher. Using this admin panel, the researcher could see the pages that the participants in the intervention group accessed on the website, and the page visit times were available in logs. The content of the website is divided into training modules. These modules were published to the users sequentially during six months period by allowing access to a new module a month. A reminder message was sent twice a week to the user regarding the subject of the training module. Application of Data Collection Tools Patient identification form, metabolic control variables form, Diabetes Self‐Care Scale and Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes were administered face‐to‐face with interviews to the individuals included in the study when they came to their outpatient clinic appointments. In the third month of the study, the laboratory results of the hospital system were obtained and the form of metabolic control variables was recorded. It has been obtained from the routine laboratory results that were checked every three months upon the doctor's request. No blood was taken from individuals by the researcher. Web‐based education was provided to the intervention group for six months. The metabolic control variables form, Diabetes Self‐Care Scale and Family Support and Conflict Scale in Type 2 Diabetes were administered by the researcher using face‐to‐face interviews, e‐mails, and mobile phone calls to the intervention and control groups based on their request at the end of the study.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05266742,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02391269/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

However, the majority ofindividuals with T2DM are unable to follow these guidelines due to a lack of consistenthealth behavior counseling offered in the primary care setting. This problem is amplifiedin remote rural communities within the U.S. In response, this project aims to create anoptimized telehealth‐based intervention ‐ Gamified Optimized Diabetes management withArtificial Intelligence‐powered Rural Telehealth (GODART). GODART is grounded in thesocial cognitive theory and will serve as an automated behavior‐monitoring andtelecoaching platform. At the core, GODART is an automated conversational‐stylebehavior‐monitoring system using natural language‐understanding technologies. In thisproject, we propose to pilot and feasibility test the various components of GODART byleveraging a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is an efficient and rigorousresource‐management and continuous‐ improvement framework for developing optimizedinterventions. Our proposal focuses on the MOST preparatory phase and will use fullfactorial experimentation. We will pilot and assess the feasibility of and evaluate twodifferent intervention components, with two levels in each of the groups, yielding fourexperimental conditions.

A key contributor to these poor health outcomes is medication non‐adherence. Twenty‐one to 42% of T2DM patients do not take blood sugar, blood pressure (BP), or statin medications as prescribed. Interventions that foster and reinforce patient‐centered communication show promise in improving health outcomes. However, they have not been widely implemented, in part due to a lack of compelling evidence for their effectiveness in real‐life primary care settings. Methods: This pragmatic cluster‐randomized trial randomizes 17 teams in 12 Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) to two experimental groups: intervention (group 1): Office‐Gap + Texting vs. control (group 2): Texting only. Office‐GAP (Office‐Guidelines Applied to Practice) is a patient activation intervention to improve communication and patient‐provider partnerships through brief patient and provider training in shared decision‐making (SDM) and use of a guideline‐based checklist. The texting intervention (Way2Health) is a cell phone messaging service that informs and encourages patients to adhere to goals, adhere to medication use and improve communication. After recruitment, patients in groups 1 and 2 will both attend (1) one scheduled group visit, (90–120 min) conducted by trained research assistants, and (2) follow‐up visits with their providers after group visit at 0–1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Data will be collected over 12‐month intervention period. Our primary outcome is medication adherence measured using eCAP electronic monitoring and self‐report. Secondary outcomes are (a) diabetes‐specific 5‐year CVD risk as measured with the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Engine score, (b) provider engagement as measured by the CollaboRATE Shared‐Decision Making measure, and (c) patient activation measures (PAM). Discussion: This study will provide a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the effectiveness of combined mHealth, and patient activation interventions compared to mHealth alone, targeting patients and healthcare providers in safety net health centers, in improving medication adherence and decreasing CVD risk. Given that 20–50% of adults with chronic illness demonstrate medication non‐adherence, increasing adherence is essential to improve CVD outcomes as well as healthcare cost savings.

Methods: Using a 1‐group longitudinal design, 115 English‐speaking adult patients with type 2 diabetes living in a health region were recruited by educators. Measures were glycated hemoglobin levels, self‐reported health, fatigue and pain, activation, empowerment, self‐efficacy, depression, communication with physician, medication adherence, health literacy and health‐care utilization. The intervention consisted of weekly 30‐min telephone calls by coaches to patients for a period of 6 months. Outcome measures were completed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. A 1‐way repeated‐measures analysis of variance assessed whether the coaching program improved the outcomes of the patients from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Results: Process recording demonstrated that peer coaches can be recruited, trained and paired with patients with type 2 diabetes for a 26‐week period. At 12 months, the mean patient glycated hemoglobin level decreased by 9%; general health improved by 7%; fatigue decreased by 15%; activation increased by 15%; empowerment increased by 10%; self‐efficacy increased by 23%; depression level decreased by 24%; and communication with physician increased by 22%. Conclusions: This pilot found that a pragmatic low‐cost telephone peer‐coaching intervention assisted patients with type 2 diabetes to self‐manage their diabetes in better ways.

The study tested the effectiveness of a telephone behavioral intervention in improving glycemic control among adults with diabetes in the New York City A1c Registry. Design RCT comparing a telephone intervention to print‐only intervention in the context of the A1c Registry program. Setting/participants Nine hundred forty‐one adults with diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) >7% from a low‐income, predominantly Latino population in the South Bronx were recruited from the A1c Registry. Intervention All study participants were mailed print diabetes self‐management materials at baseline and modest lifestyle incentives quarterly. Only the telephone participants received four calls from health educators evenly spaced over 1 year if baseline A1c was >7%‐9%, or eight calls if baseline A1c was >9%. Medication adherence was the main behavioral focus and, secondarily, nutrition and exercise. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was difference between two study arms in change in A1c from baseline to 1 year. Secondary outcomes included diabetes self‐care activities, including self‐reported medication adherence. Data were collected in 2008‐2012 and analyzed in 2012‐2014. Results Participants were predominantly Latino (67.7%) or non‐Latino black (28%), with 69.7% foreign‐born and 55.1% Spanish‐speaking. Among 694 (74%) participants with follow‐up A1c, mean A1c decreased by 0.9 (SD=0.1) among the telephone group compared with 0.5 (SD=0.1) among the print‐only group, a difference of 0.4 (95% CI=0.09, 0.74, p=0.01). The intervention had significant effect when baseline A1c was >9%. Both groups experienced similar improvements in self‐care activities, medication adherence, and intensification. Conclusions A telephone intervention delivered by health educators can be a clinically effective tool to improve diabetes control in diverse populations, specifically for those with worse metabolic control identified using a registry.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of using a smartphone app to improve medication adherence in a multiethnic Asian population with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We block randomized 51 nonadherent and digitally literate patients with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 21 and 75 years into two treatment arms (control: usual care; intervention: usual care+Medisafe app) and followed them up for 12 weeks. Recruitment occurred at a public tertiary diabetes specialist outpatient center in Singapore. The intervention group received email reminders to complete online surveys monthly, while the control group only received an email reminder(s) at the end of the study. Barriers to medication adherence and self‐appraisal of diabetes were assessed using the Adherence Starts with Knowledge‐12 (ASK‐12) and Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS) questionnaires at baseline and poststudy in both groups. Perception toward medication adherence and app usage, attitude, and satisfaction were assessed in the intervention group during and after the follow‐up period. Sociodemographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical data (ie, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, low‐density lipoprotein, high‐density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol levels) were extracted from patients' electronic medical records. RESULTS: A total of 51 (intervention group: 25 [49%]; control group: 26 [51%]) participants were randomized, of which 41 (intervention group: 22 [88.0%]; control group: 19 [73.1%]) completed the poststudy survey. The baseline‐adjusted poststudy ASK‐12 score was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference: 4.7, P=.01). No changes were observed in the clinical outcomes. The average 12‐week medication adherence rate of participants tracked by the app was between 38.3% and 100% in the intervention group. The majority (>80%) of the participants agreed that the app was easy to use and made them more adherent to their medication.

Phase 1: While the Yo Puedo! program addresses some of the needs of Mexican adults with type 2 diabetes ‐ interactive health education for low health literacy, Spanish language materials and video novellas, and activities to enhance self‐efficacy, the program was developed to address the needs of Latino immigrants in the U.S, who are from different Latin countries. The program needs to be adapted to Mexican adults with respect to personal beliefs about disease causation, cultural health practices, self‐care practices of type 2 diabetes, and issues regarding access to care. This aim will be accomplished by using an interpretive and participatory method with a collaborative team of diabetes experts in the US and Mexico, Seguro Popular clinic administrators, physicians, and nurses, and adults with T2D in Mexico City, Mexico. In focus groups and interviews, the study team will explore how the cultural context, family, and health system shape beliefs and practices related to T2D. Access and familiarity with texting technology to identify potential barriers to using a text‐messaging mHealth program will also be explored. These results will inform any modifications to the Yo Puedo! curriculum that may need to be made before Phase 2 can begin. Phase 2: A randomized, controlled pilot study design will be used in which 40 adults with T2D are randomized to the Yo Puedo + mHealth or wait‐list control condition with the hypothesis that clinical (A1C, BMI, BP), T2D self‐management, and self‐efficacy outcomes will be greater in Yo Puedo + mHealth participants compared to the wait‐list control condition at 3 and 6 month follow‐up. It is also hypothesized that the Yo Puedo + mHealth program is feasible and acceptable to adults with T2D and providers, and that fidelity of the program will be maintained. Those in the control group will be invited to participate in the program after completion of the 6‐month data collection. Interviews will be conducted with the nurse, community health worker (CHW), participants, and select clinic personnel to identify barriers, facilitators, and acceptability of the program from multiple perspectives, recognizing the complexity of the health care system. Detailed notes on the process of implementation will be carefully recorded with the purpose of identifying successful and unsuccessful components of the program (positive and negative feedback loops in a complex system). Setting. The study will be conducted in up to 10 Seguro Popular clinics. These clinics are part of the Social Protection System in Health in Mexico. Individuals who obtain health care at these clinics are covered by public health insurance (Seguro Popular), and the services offered for T2D care include medical visits, referrals to specialists and nutritionist when needed, laboratory testing, and free medicines. The medical visits include medication prescription, blood pressure management, lipid monitoring, and eye/foot care. Laboratory analyses vary from patient to patient but generally includes 3 annual tests of A1C, although other glucose, urine, and lipids tests are also available. Patients with complications are referred to specialized health centers. Evidence suggests that the impact of the Seguro Popular in adults with T2D has been positive. Interventions. All participants will receive standard T2D care at a Seguro Popular clinic as described above. The wait‐list control condition group will receive a handout on T2D self‐management and the opportunity to participate in the Yo Puedo! + mHealth program at the completion of 6‐month data collection. The Yo Puedo! + mHealth DSME program includes: a) an initial consultation with the nurse to collaboratively determine goals; b) five interactive group‐based sessions led by the CHW on T2D self‐management that is culturally relevant and at a low health literacy level (Yo Puedo! protocol adapted for Mexican context; c) behavioral support to collaboratively problem‐solve barriers to change; and d) empowerment‐based strategies to facilitate provider‐patient communication. The Yo Puedo! program will be supplemented by 2‐way text‐messaging capability provided by a web‐based platform with privacy and security rules, which allows for automated and personalized messages and a database to store all messages.

Glycemic control is challenging, particularly in resource‐limited areas that face numerous healthcare barriers. Objective: To compare HbA1c outcomes for individuals randomized to TIME, a Telehealth‐supported, Integrated care with CHWs (Community Health Workers), and MEdication‐access program (intervention) versus usual care (wait‐list control). Design: Randomized clinical trial. Participants: Low‐income Latino(a) adults with type 2 diabetes. Interventions: TIME consisted of (1) CHW‐participant telehealth communication via mobile health (mHealth) for 12 months, (2) CHW‐led monthly group visits for 6 months, and (3) weekly CHW‐physician diabetes training and support via telehealth (video conferencing). Main Measures: Investigators compared TIME versus control participant baseline to month 6 changes of HbA1c (primary outcome), blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), weight, and adherence to seven American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care. CHW assistance in identifying barriers to healthcare in the intervention group were measured at the end of mHealth communication (12 months). Key Results: A total of 89 individuals participated. TIME individuals compared to control participants had significant HbA1c decreases (9.02 to 7.59% (− 1.43%) vs. 8.71 to 8.26% (− 0.45%), respectively, p = 0.002), blood pressure changes (systolic: − 6.89 mmHg vs. 0.03 mmHg, p = 0.023; diastolic: − 3.36 mmHg vs. 0.2 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.046), and ADA guideline adherence (p < 0.001) from baseline to month 6. At month 6, more TIME than control participants achieved > 0.50% HbA1c reductions (88.57% vs. 43.75%, p < 0.001). BMI and weight changes were not significant between groups. Many (54.6%) TIME participants experienced > 1 barrier to care, of whom 91.7% had medication issues. CHWs identified the majority (87.5%) of barriers. Conclusions: TIME participants resulted in improved outcomes including HbA1c. CHWs are uniquely positioned to identify barriers to care particularly related to medications that may have gone unrecognized otherwise. Larger trials are needed to determine the scalability and sustainability of the intervention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 212 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Data from the intervention group were automatically transmitted through a glucometer; furthermore, this group received information regarding medicines, diet, exercise and other management through U‐Healthcare. The control group received conventional medical treatment without any additional intervention. All patients were regularly followed up every 3 months for half a year. RESULTS: At the 3‐month follow‐up, fasting plasma glucose levels of the intervention group were significantly lower than those at the baseline as well as those of the control group. Triglyceride levels of the intervention group were much lower than those at the baseline. At the 6‐month follow‐up, 2‐hour postprandial plasma glucose levels of the intervention group significantly improved compared with those of the control group. HbA1c levels gradually decreased every 3 months in the intervention group, and the mean change in the levels was significantly greater in this group than in the control group (from 1.27‐0.68%). At the end of the study, more than 80% of the patients in the intervention group adhered to blood glucose monitoring 2‐3 days per week, and their compliance degree was 72%. CONCLUSIONS: The Internet‐based U‐Healthcare system of integrated management in diabetes not only achieved better glycemic control, effectively improved HbA1c levels and decreased triglyceride levels but also enhanced patients' adherence to the medical team's instructions.

Novel mobile health (mHealth) approaches are potential methods for delivering tailored interventions to minority patients with increased cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a tailored mHealth adherence intervention versus attention control (AC) on medication adherence, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 3 months in 42 Black patients with uncontrolled HTN and/or T2D who were initially nonadherent to their medications. METHODS: This was a two‐phase pilot study consisting of a formative phase and a clinical efficacy phase. The formative phase consisted of qualitative interviews with 10 members of the target patient population (7/10, 70% female; mean age 65.8 years, SD 5.6) to tailor the intervention based on the Information‐Motivation‐Behavioral skills model of adherence. The clinical efficacy phase consisted of a 3‐month pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the tailored mHealth intervention versus an AC. The tablet‐delivered intervention included a tailoring survey, an individualized adherence profile, and a personalized list of interactive adherence‐promoting modules, whereas AC included the tailoring survey and health education videos delivered on the tablet. Acceptability was assessed through semistructured exit interviews. Medication adherence was assessed using the 8‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, whereas blood pressure and HbA1c were assessed using automated devices. RESULTS: In phase 1, thematic analysis of the semistructured interviews revealed the following 5 major barriers to adherence: disruptions in daily routine, forgetfulness, concerns about adverse effects, preference for natural remedies, and burdens of medication taking. Patients recommended the inclusion of modules that address improving patient‐provider communication, peer vignettes, and stress reduction strategies to facilitate adherence. A total of 42 Black patients (23/42, 55% male; mean age 57.6 years, SD 11.1) participated in the clinical efficacy pilot trial. At 3 months, both groups showed significant improvements in adherence (mean 1.35, SD 1.60; P<.001) and SBP (‐4.76 mm Hg; P=.04) with no between‐group differences (P=.50 and P=.10). The decreases in DBP and HbA1c over time were nonsignificant (‐1.97 mm Hg; P=.20; and ‐0.2%; P=.45, respectively). Patients reported high acceptability of the intervention for improving their adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated preliminary evidence on the acceptability of a tailored mHealth adherence intervention among a sample of Black patients with uncontrolled HTN and T2D who were initially nonadherent to their medications. Future research should explore whether repeated opportunities to use the mHealth intervention would result in improvements in behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. Modifications to the intervention as a result of the pilot study should guide future efforts.

Medication adherence is necessary to delay disease progression and prevent complications among uncontrolled type 2 DM patients. The objective of this research was to study how education via the Line application and telephone‐based counseling impacted medication adherence knowledge by analyzing the behavior of uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: Uncontrolled type 2 DM patients in Doi Saket Hospital, Doi Saket district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand. were included in the study. The sample was divided into an experimental (n=30) and control group (n=30). Patients who met the inclusion criteria of having uncontrolled type 2 diabetes diagnosed by a physician for at least one year, capable of communicating in Thai, possessing a mobile phone with the Line application and able to partake in activities for eight weeks were recruited in the parallel‐group randomized trial. The experimental group participated in the developed education program, while the control group received standard routine health education activities provided by their health care providers. The intervention was based on the 5Rs principle as right medicine, right dose, right route, right patient and right time and included activities via the Line application and telephone‐based counseling.

The intervention did not impact glycaemic control. We conducted a pre‐and post‐trial process evaluation alongside the StAR2D study in Malawi and South Africa, exploring the experiences and perceptions of patient participants, to better understand potential underlying reasons for the trial outcomes. METHODS: We employed a qualitative research design, including conducting semi structured in‐depth interviews and focus groups at both trial sites. Purposive sampling was used to ensure representation of a wide range of patients with type 2 diabetes with regards to age, gender, ethnicity, language, and duration of diabetes. We interviewed the same participants at baseline and at the end of the trial. We used within‐case and across‐case thematic analysis to identify key themes. RESULTS: Brief messages delivered by text were acceptable and useful for addressing informational and support needs for participants. Some participants reported behaviour changes because of the text reminders and advice on a healthy lifestyle. Both participating in the trial and the messages were experienced as a source of support, caring, and motivation. Participants' ability to act on the messages was limited. A common theme was frustration over the lack of ability to effectively control one's blood glucose level. They reported a range of routinised, partial diabetes care adherence behaviours, shaped by complex and interacting individual, social, and health service factors. Participant responses and intervention impact were similar across sites, despite differences in health services. CONCLUSION: This process evaluation provided context and insight into the factors influencing participants' engagement with the text messaging intervention. The complex context in which patients take their diabetes medication, may explain in part, why brief text messaging may have been insufficient to bring about changes in health outcomes. The scale of need for self‐management and health service support, suggests that health system strengthening, and other forms of self‐management support should accompany digital communication interventions.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 6‐month prospective, randomized, comparative, open, multicenter study included patients with type 1 diabetes >18 years old treated with multiple insulin doses and with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of >8%. We compared an intervention group (IG) (two face‐to‐face and five telematic appointments) with a control group (CG) (seven face‐to‐face appointments). The variables studied were (1) patient and healthcare team costs, (2) metabolic control, (3) knowledge of diabetes, (4) quality of life, and (5) self‐care treatment adherence. RESULTS: Of the 154 patients included, 118 (76.6%) completed the study (IG, 54; CG, 64). The time used by the CG to follow the program was 823±645 min versus 353±222 min in the IG (P<0.0001). Compared with the CG, the IG required less healthcare time from the professionals (288±105 min vs. 232±89 min; P<0.001).

There was a small but not significant increase in the proportions of participants likely to have collected 80% or more of medication (Relative risk 1.11 (0.84 to 1.47; P = 0.47). There was a significant difference between groups in change in systolic blood pressure from baseline of 3.46 mmHg (1.48 to 5.44, P = 0.001) in favour of the intervention group. The between group difference in change in 10‐year risk of coronary heart disease was ‐ 0.71% (‐ 1.46 to 0.04, P = 0.064). The proportion of participants meeting treatment goals in the intervention group was 36.0% and in the control group 26.8% (Relative risk 1.36 (1.13 to 1.63, P = 0.001). Participants reported many challenges to adherence despite finding messages acceptable and useful. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst SMS text messages do not lead to improved glycaemia in these low‐resource settings there appeared to be an impact on blood pressure and achievement of treatment goals but the mechanisms for this are unclear. Text messages alone, may be unsuccessful unless accompanied by health system strengthening and other forms of self‐management support for type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare how African Americans and non‐African Americans with diabetes responded to a multifactorial telehealth intervention designed to slow kidney function decline. RESEARCH DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial. Primary care patients (N=281, 56% African American) were allocated to either: (1) a multifactorial, pharmacist‐delivered phone‐based telehealth intervention focused on behavioral and medication management of diabetic kidney disease; or (2) an education control. MEASURES: The primary study outcome was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Linear mixed models were used to explore the moderating effect of race on the relationship between study arm and eGFR decline over time; the mean annual rate of eGFR decline was estimated by race and study arm. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated a differential intervention effect on kidney function over time by race (Pinteraction=0.005). Among African Americans, the intervention arm had significantly greater preservation of eGFR over time than the control arm (difference in the annual rate of eGFR decline=1.5 mL/min/1.73 m; 95% confidence interval: 0.04, 3.02). For non‐African Americans, the intervention arm had a faster decline in eGFR over time than the control arm (difference in the annual rate of eGFR decline=‐1.7 mL/min/1.73 m; 95% confidence interval: ‐3.3, ‐0.02). CONCLUSION: A multifactorial, pharmacist‐delivered telehealth intervention for diabetic kidney disease may be more effective for slowing eGFR decline among African Americans than non‐African Americans.",58,11,968‐973,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 32833935,EMBASE 632700854,,,,Journal article,"*diabetic nephropathy; *race difference; *telehealth; Adolescent; Adult; African American; Aged; Article; Black or African American [*education]; Controlled study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [complications, ethnology]; Diabetic Nephropathies [ethnology, *prevention & control]; Disease Management; Education; Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Health Behavior [*ethnology]; Human; Humans; Kidney function; Major clinical study; Male; Medication Adherence [ethnology]; Medication therapy management; Middle Aged; Outcome assessment; Patient Education as Topic [organization & administration]; Pharmacist; Pharmacists; Primary medical care; Racial Groups [education]; Randomized controlled trial; Secondary analysis; Socioeconomic Factors; Telemedicine [*organization & administration]; Telephone; White People [education]; Young Adult",10.1097/MLR.0000000000001387,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02177422/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Closed loop arm Following randomisation, participants in the closed‐loop group will receive training to cover key aspects of insulin pump use and CGM. Competency on the use of study devices will be evaluated Once competent in the use of the study pump and CGM, participants will receive training required for safe and effective use of the closed‐loop system. During a 2‐4 hour session participants will operate the system under the supervision of the clinical team. Competency on the use of closed‐loop system will be evaluated. Thereafter, participants are expected to use closed‐loop for 20 days without supervision or remote monitoring. All participants will be provided with 24 hour telephone helpline and will also be given written instructions about when to contact clinical team. Procedures for safety monitoring during trial Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events (AE) will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE). A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals. A participant may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are: 3. Failure to satisfy competency assessment 4.

71,71,CN-02631249,"NCT06150508,",Randomized Controlled Trial of the Smart O2O Model Development for Chronic Diseases Management Through Digital Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06150508,2023,"Objectives The objective of this intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Online‐to‐Offline(O2O) Service Model developed to provide primary healthcare and management of chronic diseases targeting patients residing in Pyeongchang‐gun at the local government level. The randomized controlled trial of this intervention will help verifying the model, and provide valuable information about the effectiveness of an O2O digital healthcare service for patients with diabetes and hypertension. If the intervention is found to be effective, it has the potential to improve access to care and self‐management for patients, which could lead to improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. The implications from this study can also serve as credible evidence for decision making for provision of digital health care services in other regions of Korea as well. Trial design This is a randomized controlled trial with restricted, batch, blocked and individual random assignment. For sampling before randomization, investigators plan to recruit two target disease groups in Pyeongchang‐gun: one group with diabetes patients (including pre‐diabetes patients), and another with hypertension patients (including borderline hypertension patients). Total 1,000 participants (500 per group) will be recruited, and the investigators plan to prioritize the poorly controlled patients when recruiting. Primary mode of sampling is voluntary based, where patients sign up through the advertisement, promotional campaign, or information provided by the physicians. Some patients will be recommended and informed to join this trial by their physicians while promotional/advertising materials will be posted at participating medical centers((i.e., Pyeongchang Public Medical Center and local private clinic, local private medical centres in Pyeongchang) and the Pyeongchang official website. Flyers will also be distributed through voluntary village health supporting groups‐named Village Health Committee. In the meantime, for patients who have already diagnosed to have diabetes and hypertension will also be recruited from participating medical centres in Pyeongchang (i.e., local medical centres, Pyeongchang Public Medical center). When eligible patients who are willing to participate in this study visits local health centre for clinical tests, their data will be periodically sent to the research team to carry out blocked random assignment (block: disease, severity, region). The assignment results are notified to the centre/clinic and then to the patients. The allocation ratio is 1:1 for each disease (hypertension and diabetes). Study setting The intervention will take place in Pyeongchang‐gun, Kangwon‐do, South Korea. (Pyeongchang‐gun is a county in the province of Gangwon‐do, South Korea. It is in the eastern part of the province with a population of around 43 thousand people estimated in 2020.) The Smart Healthcare Center affiliated to Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang will primarily manage the O2O service by providing necessary education and human resources while receiving and monitoring data from each participant and local medical centers. As mentioned, the intervention targets patients (and borderline patients) in Pyeongchang, and the data is collected from participating patients through the device and application as well as from the local medical centers when patients participate in (both control and treatment group) regular follow‐ups. The overall study (including the design of trial) is managed by Seoul National University College of Medicine while the provision of O2O service and data collection are primarily in charge of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang. There are stakeholders to develop and manage the O2O model (specifically the mobile application, data platform), such as Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Huray and DKI, and Seoul National University Hospital as well as XAIMED are in charge of managing the Public Health HRecord (PHR) data collected from the patients and local medical centers. Interventions Intervention in O2O Service Model: Following baseline comprehensive health examinations, each participant's primary attending physician will develop an individualized care plan. This care plan includes identifying the representative disease group (diabetes, pre‐diabetes, hypertension, borderline‐hypertension) and determining the intensity of care (intensive or standard). In cases where participants have both diabetes and hypertension, they are categorized as diabetes patients. Participants with poorly controlled diseases (systolic blood pressure exceeding 140 or diastolic pressure over 90 in the hypertension group, and HbA1c levels exceeding 6.5% in the diabetes group) are assigned to the intensive care group. However, these classifications can be adjusted as necessary based on the patient's clinical condition. The Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, in collaboration with physicians, continuously monitors and intervenes as needed. Monitoring occurs through the administrator's web page of the O2O service platform, allowing oversight of the life‐log data of the intervention group. Enrolled patients receive interventions in the form of automated or manual messages. ‐ Message Delivery through the Application: Personalized Educational Material: The content of these messages is determined based on the participant's baseline evaluation results. They consist of publicly available videos produced by reputable organizations, including academic societies, and are provided via links to YouTube videos. Health Reports: Sent every three months, these reports provide a comprehensive evaluation of whether the individual's condition is being well managed based on life‐log data from the past three months. Manual Messages (Texted Messages): Indicator‐based personalized messages are manually transcribed, evaluating the state of health management over the last two or four weeks based on life‐log data. These messages are primarily drafted by the Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, using pre‐made message templates created by healthcare experts (doctors, nutritionists, nurses, etc.) suitable for each situation. Messages are sent to patients after final confirmation by their respective primary physicians. Additional messages can be sent as needed during the monitoring process, especially if blood pressure or blood glucose levels are at cautionary or dangerous levels or if data entry is insufficient. ‐ Continuous Glucose Monitor (Among the Intervention Group): Some diabetes patients in the intervention group will be provided with a continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre). Eligibility for this monitor is determined based on their recorded glucose levels not reaching the normal range in more than half of their recent examinations within the latest 14 days. Patients eligible for the continuous glucose monitor receive notifications via text or phone call from the Smart Healthcare Center. They are required to attach the device for two weeks and are advised to self‐monitor their glucose variations. During this period, they are strongly encouraged to manage their glucose levels by adapting their usual lifestyle. Some patients may receive the monitor again, if needed, two weeks after the detachment of the device. ‐ Personal Health Record (PHR) Data: PHR data can be accessed and utilized exclusively by attending physicians with patient consent through the participant's personal online datastore (POD) web view in the clinic. POD can import health screening results, medical history, and prescription history provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), which is mandatory for all citizens to enroll in. Additionally, POD contains AI‐based retinal image analysis capable of detecting ophthalmologic abnormalities (e.g., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) and predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk. It also includes another CVD incidence prediction model developed using national health screening data. With access to this PHR data, attending physicians can provide comprehensive consultations to patients regarding their CVD risk. ‐ Control Group: The control group will receive treatment as usual, which is the typical care provided to individuals without the additional interventions described above. Strategies to improve adherence to interventions Patients will be regularly reminded to use the mobile‐app to check up their medical conditions with mobile alarms, notifications and in‐person notification from the Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang Medical Center Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial Treat of as usual (TAU) is allowed for both control and treatment group. However, the investigators believe that patients' participation in alternative services will be the most difficult problem to solve during the study. The investigators have identified 'participating in another research program involving smart health technology' as one of the exclusion criteria. will not be eligible for inclusion in our study. At the same time, the investigators will further prevent concomitant care (that might be possible during the intervention) through information provision and by educating the operators who will be in charge of training and informing the patients for service utilization Sample size Sample size is calculated using MDES (Minimum Detectable Effect Size) equation. The sample size for this study is determined with the aim of detecting a meaningful difference between the treatment and control groups with sufficient statistical power. Given that the total sample size is 1000 participants, the investigators will divide this cohort into two main groups: participants with diabetes and those with hypertension. Subsequently, each of these two groups will be randomly allocated into treatment and control subgroups. Calculation of MDES is separately carried out for the diabetes and hypertension groups, taking into account the unique characteristics and expected effect sizes within each group. Assuming that the variation in the outcome variable that can be explained by blocked random assignment and control variable is about 50%, and assuming a sample of 500 subjects with a 5:5 allocation ratio, with a statistical significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, the MDES is 0.216. If the investigators assume that the variation in the outcome variable that can be explained by blocked random assignment and control variable is about 25%, the MDES is 0.187, which is still high in accuracy. Assuming that the variation in the outcome variable that can be explained by blocked random assignment and control variable is about 10%, the MDES is 0.181, which is still high in accuracy. (Note: Cohen (1988) suggested that an MDES of 0.20 is a small effect size, 0.50 is a medium effect size, and 0.80 is a large effect size.) Therefore, the investigators aim to recruit the sample of 500 participants for each disease type, and the treatment‐to‐control ration is 5:5 for each disease group Recruitment There are two concurrent recruitment procedures, each with slight distinction. Procedure 1 primarily targets patients previously diagnosed with diabetes, pre‐diabetes, hypertension, or borderline hypertension. Procedure 2 targets respondents who have been exposed to our promotion and advertisement efforts. For these respondents who voluntarily asked to enroll, their eligibility will be confirmed when they are either: 1) Previously diagnosed with diabetes, borderline diabetes, hypertension, or borderline hypertension (with proof of diagnosis) or 2) Newly diagnosed with any of these conditions through the comprehensive health check‐up included in this intervention procedure. Assignment of interventions: allocation Sequence generation Participants will be randomized using a computer‐generated randomization sequence. This study will apply a restricted, batch, blocked, individual random assignment. After screening the participant eligibility, each eligible participant will be contacted to receive informed consent. For those who consented to participate will visit the local medical center (or smart healthcare center) for detailed explanation of service, to physically signed the agreement, receive training to use the mobile app, and respond the survey. After patients receive clinical tests at the clinic, the list of patients and test results are periodically sent to the research team. The research team conducts blocked random assignment periodically based on disease, severity, and region. The assignment results are notified to the center and clinic and then to the patients by the research team. Such process is designed to align to the O2O service process. Concealment mechanism Mechanism of implementing the allocation sequence is using central telephone and email. The health care staffs and participants won't know the allocation until the research team inform them. Implementation The research team will generate the allocation sequence, deliver the allocation results to the center and patients directly. The staffs of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang Public Medical Center will enroll participants and assign participants to interventions. Assignment of interventions: Blinding Who will be blinded Once the random assignment is conducted, no blinding will take place for this study. Data collection and management Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes Data Quality Assurance: To ensure the integrity of our survey data, the investigators have implemented several processes to promote data quality. First, the investigators plan to employ duplication risk mitigation measures by cross‐referencing participant phone numbers and birth dates. This step helps identify and rectify any duplicate entries, maintaining the accuracy and uniqueness of our dataset. Second, our assessors will be rigorously trained to conduct surveys effectively. The investigators have developed a comprehensive manual guide to standardize data collection procedures. This guide serves as a valuable resource for our assessors, ensuring consistency and adherence to established protocols. Furthermore, prior to the commencement of the intervention, the assessors will also undergo a pre‐intervention session. During this session, they will receive training on data collection processes, ensuring their familiarity with survey instruments and questionnaires. Additionally, our Smart Healthcare Center plays a pivotal role as a call center, promptly addressing any issues or queries that may arise during data collection. This continuous support mechanism helps maintain data quality throughout the study. Study Instruments: For data collection, the investigators have developed survey questionnaires and interview guides. These instruments have been meticulously crafted, drawing from health outcome indicators aligned with clinical guidelines. This alignment ensures that our data collection tools are both relevant and comprehensive, enabling us to capture essential information related to our study objectives. Our commitment to data quality and the robustness of our study instruments underpins the reliability and validity of the data collected, ensuring the credibility of our research findings. List of Data Data to be collected for this study can be categorized into 'Record of Random 'Assignment,' 'Baseline,' 'Outcome,' 'Service Utilization data,' 'Service Cost Data'. Plans to promote participant retention and complete follow‐up The research team's strategy to retain the completeness of random assignment while managing any contamination or drop‐out is the following: ‐ Conduct a pilot random assignment for about a week to identify any issues. ‐ Continuously check the size of Treatment group (T) and Comparison group © considering the sample size by group to monitor the possibility of non‐random assignment. ‐ Issue of random assignment of ineligible applicants: If found in both T and C, they will be dropped from the sample; if found only in T, no‐show adjustment will be made at the analysis stage. ‐ Control group contamination: 1. Identify Contamination by participants vs. contamination by operators 2. Education for operators 3. Minimizing face‐to‐face contact between operators and participants 4. Direct notification of random assignment results to participants by the research team ‐ Cross‐over: When the controller applies for random allocation again. Do not remove from the sample, but handle as no‐show adjustment at the analysis stage. The field operators (i.e., staffs of Smart Healthcare Center and Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang) will regularly check‐up with the patients to remind them to use the mobile application, while the patients will be automatically notified via app notification and e‐mails for service use. When participants request discontinuation, they will be asked to fill out the follow‐up survey and their medical records (from medical centers and National Health Insurance Service) will be collected at the point of discontinuation. For deviated participants, medical records (from medical centers and National Insurance Service) will be collected when the deviation is identified. Data management The data management plan is the following for each process: Data entry: All data will be entered using electronic data capture (EDC) software. Two independent operators will perform double data entry for accuracy. Coding: A coding manual will be created to ensure consistency in coding. All coded data will be verified by a second operator for accuracy. Security: Access to the data will be password‐protected, and only authorized personnel will have access. The data will be stored on a secure server that is regularly backed up. Storage: The data will be stored in an electronic format. The data will be stored on a secure server located within the research institution. Data quality processes: Range checks will be performed to ensure that data values fall within acceptable ranges. Data cleaning procedures will be performed to correct any discrepancies or missing data. The final dataset will be verified for completeness and accuracy by the research team before analysis. Backup and archiving: The data will be regularly backed up to ensure its integrity in case of system failure or loss. A copy of the final dataset will be archived in a secure location for future reference. According to Article 15 of the Enforcement Rules of the Bioethics and Safety Act, all research‐related records and data will be archived for three years from the end of the research. Data Disposal: Seoul National University, an institution that is in charge of retention, will dispose of any data and document containing personal information in accordance with Article 16 of Enforcement Decree of the Personal Information Protection Act after three years of archiving. Confidentiality The investigators will collect personal information about potential and enrolled participants through informed consent forms, medical records, and questionnaires. The investigators will ensure that all personal information is securely stored and accessed only by authorized personnel. The investigators will share personal information only with the research team and regulatory agencies, and the investigators will do so through password‐protected access or encryption to ensure confidentiality. The specific protocols are as follows: The participant is provided with sufficient explanation and, if voluntarily agreed, signs a written consent form to participate in the research. Confidentiality will be maintained for information that can identify the personal information. Information can be provided if the participant inquires about the test results. The participant's data file will be stored on the server of the data management personnel. This server is accessible only to the principal investigator, research staff, and co‐researchers, and the file is encrypted. Therefore, access is not possible except for those who participated in this research. The data file collected during the research process will be provided to a third party (National Health Smart Management Research and Development Division under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Government of South Korea) and submitted to the data platform (big data and personal data repository) established by the division. In this process, personal information is protected by applying the integrated authentication system and DID (Decentralized Identifier, a distributed identification technology based on blockchain technology) system developed by the division. Statistical methods For the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will employ ITT(Intention‐to‐Treat) and Regression‐Adjusted Impact Estimate. When data allows (especially data from control group), the investigators will also conduct timeseries effect analysis. The occurrence of program effects and how these effects change over time are crucial pieces of information to be derived from this experimental study. Analysing the temporal trajectory of program effects is essential, as the timing of impact and the nature of the program can result in diverse patterns of change based on the severity of disease or behavioural patterns of patients. In randomized experiments, comparability between randomly assigned program and control groups remains consistent over time. Therefore, analysing the time‐series changes in program effects can be achieved by applying cross‐sectional analysis methods (i.e., Equation (1)) at each time point. To investigate the time‐series changes in program effects across multiple time points, the dependent variable (outcome variable) should be measured at each time point to estimate program effects repeatedly. It's important to note that, in Equation (1), the variables that change over time are the dependent variables only, while program variables and control variables remain constant. This is because, the distinction between program and control groups should not change over time, and control variables should be obtained prior to random allocation. An important consideration for this analysis is that the ""time"" mentioned is relative, not absolute. It is measured relative to the random assignment date, not an absolute calendar year. Therefore, evaluators will record the random assignment date for all sample members and integrate it into the analysis dataset. The dependent variables obtained from administrative statistical databases should also be transformed into relative time variables based on the random assignment date for analysis. Methods in analysis to handle protocol non‐adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data Defiers in the Treatment Group: In the event that there is non‐adherence to the protocol, particularly if there are individuals who defy the assigned treatment, the investigators will estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). Since the control group will not be provided with the application, there is no possibility of 'defiers' in the control group. Therefore, the investigators will simply divide the ITT with the rate of compliers. LATE= ITT/(Rate of Compliers (in Treatment Group)) To address missing data for variables of interest, the investigators will use a missing‐dummy approach, specifically employing dummy variable adjustment. This method involves creating dummy variables to account for missing data and subsequently including these dummy variables in our analysis as covariates. This approach allows us to compensate for missing data and maintain the completeness of our analysis while minimizing the impact of missing observations on our results. Oversight and monitoring Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee Composition and Roles of Key Entities: The O2O service is orchestrated by a collaborative effort between the ""Smart Healthcare Center"" personnel and healthcare professionals situated at each patient's primary care clinic. The Smart Healthcare Center operates under the umbrella of the Public Health Center (PHC) of Pyeongchang‐gun and comprises our dedicated team of researchers alongside PHC staff members. Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprises members from the evaluation team, ensuring a diverse range of expertise to oversee the trial's data and processes. The Data Monitoring Committee plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and quality of trial data. Its responsibilities include monthly monitoring and feedback sessions to assess the trial's progress and adherence to protocols. The Data Monitoring Committee reports its findings directly to the Principal Investigator (PI), providing valuable insights and recommendations to enhance the trial's efficacy and safety. Importantly, the Data Monitoring Committee operates independently from the intervention itself. Its members do not have direct involvement with participating medical centers and the Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center. This independence ensures unbiased evaluation and decision‐making regarding the trial's progress and safety. Adverse event reporting and harms The likelihood of adverse events or unintended effects related to trial interventions or trial conduct is not anticipated to be high. However, in the event that such occurrences do arise, our response protocol is well‐established. Any solicited or spontaneously reported adverse events will be promptly reported to the Principal Investigator (PI) overseeing the trial. Simultaneously, these events will be reported to the Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) Committee, the regulatory body responsible for overseeing the ethical and safety aspects of the trial. Upon notification of an adverse event or unintended effect, relevant and appropriate actions will be taken in response. These actions may include further investigation, adjustments to trial conduct, or any necessary modifications to ensure participant safety and the integrity of the trial.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06150508,,,Trial registry record,Chronic Disease; Diabetes Mellitus,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02631249/full,Hypertension,humans,clinical trial,True,False

OPTIMUM HTM includes in‐app video‐based tele‐education, tele‐monitoring of the blood pressure, capillary glucose and weight via Bluetooth devices and mobile applications, followed by algorithm‐based tele‐management by the OPTIMUM HTM team. Assessments using self‐care inventory scale and medication adherence were administered for both groups at baseline, 6‐month, and 12‐month timepoints. RESULTS: Complete data from 156 (intervention) and 159 (control) participants, with comparable demographic profiles, were analysed. Both groups showed a significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (p < 0.001). From 6‐month to 12‐month time‐points, the intervention group was twice as likely to maintain their HbA1c ≤ 8% (adjusted odds ratio = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.18‐3.49; p < 0.011). The intervention group demonstrated higher scores for self‐care behaviours (adjusted odds ratio = 3.83 [95%CI = 1.68‐5.97], p = 0.001) and not skipping medications (adjusted odds ratio = 2.32 [95%CI = 1.09‐4.97], p = 0.030) at 12 months. DISCUSSION: The OPTIMUM HTM system enabled patients to maintain their glycaemic control beyond the intervention period. The favourable outcomes could be the effect of telehealth in sustaining self‐care behaviour and medication adherence.",,,1357633X241261733,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 39091047,EMBASE 644916586,,,,Journal article,*diabetes mellitus; *medication compliance; *non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; *primary medical care; *self care; *telehealth; *telemedicine; *telemonitoring; Adult; Aged; Algorithm; Article; Capillary pressure; Controlled study; Drug therapy; Female; Glucose blood level; Human; Major clinical study; Male; Mobile application; Randomized controlled trial; Videorecording,10.1177/1357633X241261733,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02736496/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions that incorporate wearables may be able to improve diabetes self‐management. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of personalized educational and behavioral interventions delivered through an EMPOWER mobile application (app) among patients with T2DM. Methods: This is a parallel two‐arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T2DM recruited from primary care will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive personalized educational and behavioral interventions through the EMPOWER app in addition to their usual clinical care. The control group will receive the usual clinical care for their T2DM but will not have access to the EMPOWER app. Our primary outcome is patient activation score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include HbA1c, physical activity level and diet throughout 12 months; quality of life (QoL), medication adherence, direct healthcare cost and indirect healthcare cost at 6 and 12 months. Discussion: This RCT will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and implementation of personalized educational and behavioral interventions delivered through mobile application in T2DM management.

We seek to determine whether a scalable, low‐cost, unidirectional, text message‐based mobile health intervention (TExT‐MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population. METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level ≥8%) in an urban, public ED. The TExT‐MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self‐efficacy, performance of self‐care tasks, quality of life, diabetes‐specific knowledge, ED utilization, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT‐MED group compared with 0.60% in the controls (Δ0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] ‐0.27 to 1.17) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT‐MED group, with the most sizable change observed in self‐reported medication adherence (as measured by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8‐point validated scale with higher scores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the TExT‐MED group compared with a net decrease of ‐0.1 in the controls (Δ1.1 [95% CI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication adherence (1.1 versus ‐0.3; Δ1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (‐1.2% versus ‐0.4%) in the TExT‐MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency services trended lower in the TExT‐MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; Δ15.7%; 95% CI 9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT‐MED and 100% would recommend it to family/friends. CONCLUSION: The TExT‐MED program did not result in a statistically significant improvement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome of Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were observed, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT‐MED also decreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish‐speaking subgroup.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and applicability of a mobile phone‐based glucose‐monitoring and feedback system for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in multiple primary care clinic settings. METHODS: In this multicenter, cluster‐randomized controlled, open trial, 13 primary care clinics in Seoul and other large cities in South Korea were voluntarily recruited. Overall, 150 (9 clinics) and 97 (4 clinics) participants with T2DM were assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively (2:1 allocation). Every month, participants in both groups attended face‐to‐face physicians' consultation for the management of diabetes in the clinic. For the intervention group, participants were required to upload their daily self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results using the mobile phone app in addition to outpatient care for 3 months. The results were automatically transmitted to the main server. Physicians had to check their patients' SMBG results through an administrator's website and send a short feedback message at least once a week. At baseline and 3 months, both groups had anthropometry and blood tests, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and responded to questionnaires about treatment satisfaction and compliance. RESULTS: At 3 months, participants in the intervention group showed significantly more improvement in HbA1c (adjusted mean difference to control ‐0.30%, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.11; P=.003) and fasting plasma glucose (‐17.29 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐29.33 to ‐5.26; P=.005) than those in the control group. In addition, there was significantly more reduction in blood pressure, and the score regarding treatment satisfaction and motivation for medication adherence increased more in the intervention group than in the control group. In the subgroup analyses, the effect on glycemic control was more significant among younger patients and higher baseline HbA1c levels. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile phone‐based glucose‐monitoring and feedback system was effective in glycemic control when applied in primary care clinic settings. This system could be utilized effectively with diverse institutions and patients.

Telemedicine interventions may counter both treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia. INTRODUCTION: We explored why a telemedicine intervention designed to reduce treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia did not improve CVD risk factor control, despite enhancing treatment adherence versus usual care. METHODS: In this analysis of a randomized trial, we studied recipients of the 12‐month telemedicine intervention. This intervention comprised two nurse‐administered components: (1) monthly self‐management education targeting improved treatment adherence; and (2) quarterly medication management facilitation designed to support treatment intensification by primary care (thereby reducing clinical inertia). For each medication management facilitation encounter, we ascertained whether patients met treatment goals, and if not, whether primary care recommended treatment intensification following the encounter. We assessed disease control associated with encounters, where intensification was/was not recommended. RESULTS: We examined 455 encounters across 182 intervention recipients (100% African Americans with type 2 diabetes). Even after accounting for valid reasons for deferring intensification (e.g., treatment nonadherence), intensification was not recommended in 67.5% of encounters in which hemoglobin A1c was above goal, 72.5% in which systolic blood pressure was above goal, and 73.9% in which low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol was above goal. In each disease state, treatment intensification was more likely with poorer control. CONCLUSIONS: Despite enhancing treatment adherence, this intervention was unsuccessful in countering clinical inertia, likely explaining its lack of effect on CVD risk factors.

However, more information is needed to evaluate the potential benefits of family‐based intervention through a mobile application by pharmacists in the older diabetes patients. Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of family support‐based intervention via a mobile application by pharmacists on clinical outcomes, family behaviour, diabetes knowledge, self‐management practices and medication adherence in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital in the south of Thailand with 9 months of follow‐up. Family members in the intervention group (n = 78) received diabetes educational courses and encouragement via a mobile application from pharmacists to help their older relatives with diabetes in self‐management tasks. The control group received usual care (n = 79). Results As compared to baseline, significant improvements were observed in the intervention patients for glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, family behaviour in diabetes care, diabetes knowledge, self‐management practices and medication adherence (P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This trial aimed to assess the behavioral efficacy of a highly tailored digital intervention to support medication adherence and to evaluate the feasibility of its clinical effectiveness, in patients with either or both hypertension and type 2 diabetes. We also examined quality of life and mechanisms of behavior change. Intervention fidelity, engagement, and satisfaction were also explored. METHODS: This was a multicenter, individually randomized controlled trial of 2 parallel groups: an intervention group that received a highly tailored text message and interactive voice response intervention for 12 weeks, and a control group that received usual care. Medication adherence was measured using self‐reports and assessor‐blinded practice records of a repeat prescription. Systolic blood pressure and glucose levels were assessed by nurses blinded to group allocation during practice visits at 3 months follow‐up. Questionnaires obtained data to assess intervention mechanisms of action and satisfaction and digital log files captured data to evaluate fidelity and engagement. RESULTS: A total of 135 nonadherent patients (62/135, 46% female; 122/135, 90.3%; aged above 50 years) were randomly allocated in the intervention (n=79) or in the control group (n=56); of whom 13% (18/135) were lost at follow‐up. Medication adherence was significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control group (t116=2.27; P=.02, 2‐tailed). Systolic blood pressure was 0.6 mmHg (95% CI ‐7.423 to 6.301), and hemoglobin A1c was 4.5 mmol/mol (95% CI ‐13.099 to 4.710) lower in the intervention group compared with the control group. Changes in intentional nonadherence and nonintentional nonadherence explained the improvements in medication adherence in the intervention group (beta=.074, SE=0.464; P=.04), but not in the control group (beta=.00, SE 1.35; P=.37). The intervention had 100% fidelity, a median of 12 days of engagement, and 76% overall satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial is the first that has been conducted in the United Kingdom and showed that among nonadherent patients with either or both hypertension and type 2 diabetes, a highly tailored digital intervention was effective at improving treatment adherence and feasible to obtain clinically meaningful outcomes. Changes in intentional and nonintentional nonadherence predicted the improvements in medication adherence. The intervention had high fidelity, engagement, and satisfaction. Future research using a rigorous design is needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the intervention in primary care.

Digital storytelling interventions are narrative‐based videos elicited through a community‐based participatory research approach to surface the authentic voices of participants overcoming obstacles to health‐promoting behaviors that perpetuate health inequities; research on the effect of digital storytelling on T2D outcomes among Hispanic adults is lacking. Objective: To assess the impact of a digital storytelling intervention on glycemic control and its acceptability among Hispanic patients with poorly controlled T2D. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted within 2 primary care networks in Minnesota and Arizona among Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D (hemoglobin A1clevel ≥8%). Enrollment and follow‐up were conducted between February 14, 2019, and November 1, 2023. Intervention: The intervention group viewed a 12‐minute digital storytelling video. The video included 4 Spanish‐language stories that reinforced 4 diabetes self‐management behavioral goals (healthful diet for diabetes, physical activity, medication adherence, and glucose self‐monitoring). The control group received printed, culturally tailored T2D education materials. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 3 months for hemoglobin A1clevels, adjusting for baseline hemoglobin A1c, age, gender, education, and income. Acceptability and narrative quality of the intervention were assessed through questionnaires. Results: There were 451 study participants, with 227 (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [9.3] years; 158 [69.3%] women) randomized to the intervention group and 224 (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [9.1] years; 156 [69.3%] women) to the control group. Of these, 390 completed 3‐month follow‐up of the primary outcome (86% retention). There was a small improvement in the mean (SD) hemoglobin A1clevel in the intervention group compared with the control group in the adjusted model (9.1% [1.7] to 8.4% [1.6] vs 9.4% [1.8] to 8.8% [2.0]; P =.04] but not in the unadjusted model. Acceptability and narrative quality of the intervention were high. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, a digital storytelling intervention developed with and for Hispanic adults with T2D was highly acceptable and feasibly implemented within primary care settings and resulted in a modest improvement of glycemic control. This was a highly scalable intervention that may be integrated into clinical practice as part of a longitudinal diabetes self‐management program for Hispanic adults.

Up to 55% of US Hispanics born in the year 2000 are expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. Poor healthcare access and cultural barriers prevent optimal care, adherence, and clinical benefit, placing Hispanics at disproportionate risk for costly diabetes complications. Mobile technology is increasingly prevalent in all populations and can circumvent such barriers. Our group developed Dulce Digital, an educational text messaging program that improved glycemic control relative to usual care. Dulce Digital‐Me (DD‐Me) has been tailored to a participant’s individual needs with a greater focus on health behavior change. Methods: This is a three‐arm, parallel group, randomized trial with equal allocation ratio enrolling Hispanic adults with low income and poorly managed type 2 diabetes (N = 414) from a San Diego County Federally Qualified Health Center. Participants are randomized to receive Dulce Digital, Dulce Digital‐Me‐Automated, or Dulce Digital‐Me‐Telephonic. The DD‐Me groups include Dulce Digital components plus personalized goal‐setting and feedback delivered via algorithm‐driven automated text messaging (DD‐Me‐Automated) or by the care team health coach (DD‐Me‐Telephonic) over a 12‐month follow‐up period. The study will examine the comparative effectiveness of the three groups in improving diabetes clinical control [HbA1c, primary outcome; low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), and systolic blood pressure (SBP)] and patient‐provider communication and patient adherence (i.e., medication, self‐management tasks) over 12 months and will examine cost‐effectiveness of the three interventions. Discussion: Our comparative evaluation of three mHealth approaches will elucidate how technology can be integrated most effectively and efficiently within primary care‐based chronic care model approaches to reduce diabetes disparities in Hispanics and will assess two modes of personalized messaging delivery (i.e., automated messaging vs. telephonic by health coach) to inform cost and acceptability.

Design: Phase III, 12‐months, two‐arm (1:1 allocation ratio), randomized parallel‐group trial. Methods: We will recruit 740 adults with glycated hemoglobin (A1c) >8% (>64 mmol/mol) and with at least one prescription of a non‐insulin antidiabetic drug. They will be allocated to a control (usual care) group or an intervention (DiabeText messaging intervention) group. The primary outcome measure will be A1c at 12 months follow‐up. Secondary outcomes will include medication possession ratio and behavioral and psychological outcomes. Discussion: Recent trials suggest that digital health interventions can effectively support diabetes self‐management improving T2D control and reducing important T2D complications. In Spain this type of interventions is understudied. Impact: This trial will strengthen the evidence base of the impact of mHealth interventions to support diabetes self‐management.

A key contributor to these poor health outcomes is medication non‐adherence. Twenty‐one to 42% of T2DM patients do not take blood sugar, blood pressure (BP), or statin medications as prescribed. Interventions that foster and reinforce patient‐centered communication show promise in improving health outcomes. However, they have not been widely implemented, in part due to a lack of compelling evidence for their effectiveness in real‐life primary care settings. METHODS: This pragmatic cluster‐randomized trial randomizes 17 teams in 12 Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) to two experimental groups: intervention (group 1): Office‐Gap + Texting vs. control (group 2): Texting only. Office‐GAP (Office‐Guidelines Applied to Practice) is a patient activation intervention to improve communication and patient‐provider partnerships through brief patient and provider training in shared decision‐making (SDM) and use of a guideline‐based checklist. The texting intervention (Way2Health) is a cell phone messaging service that informs and encourages patients to adhere to goals, adhere to medication use and improve communication. After recruitment, patients in groups 1 and 2 will both attend (1) one scheduled group visit, (90‐120 min) conducted by trained research assistants, and (2) follow‐up visits with their providers after group visit at 0‐1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Data will be collected over 12‐month intervention period. Our primary outcome is medication adherence measured using eCAP electronic monitoring and self‐report. Secondary outcomes are (a) diabetes‐specific 5‐year CVD risk as measured with the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Engine score, (b) provider engagement as measured by the CollaboRATE Shared‐Decision Making measure, and (c) patient activation measures (PAM). DISCUSSION: This study will provide a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the effectiveness of combined mHealth, and patient activation interventions compared to mHealth alone, targeting patients and healthcare providers in safety net health centers, in improving medication adherence and decreasing CVD risk. Given that 20‐50% of adults with chronic illness demonstrate medication non‐adherence, increasing adherence is essential to improve CVD outcomes as well as healthcare cost savings.

However, the effectiveness of apps in mobile health (mHealth) interventions is inconclusive and unclear due to heterogeneous interventions and varying follow‐up durations. In addition, randomized controlled trial data are limited, and long‐term follow‐up is lacking, especially for apps integrated into electronic medical records. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effect of an electronic medical record‐integrated mobile app for personalized diabetes self‐care, focusing on the self‐monitoring of blood glucose and lifestyle modifications, on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In a 26‐week, 3‐arm, randomized, controlled, open‐label, parallel group trial, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of ≥7.5% were recruited. The mHealth intervention consisted of self‐monitoring of blood glucose with the automatic transfer of glucose, diet, and physical activity counseling data (iCareD system). Participants were randomly assigned to the following three groups: usual care (UC), mobile diabetes self‐care (MC), and MC with personalized, bidirectional feedback from physicians (MPC). The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c levels at 26 weeks. In addition, diabetes‐related self‐efficacy, self‐care activities, and satisfaction with the iCareD system were assessed after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 269 participants were enrolled, and 234 patients (86.9%) remained in the study at 26 weeks. At 12 weeks after the intervention, the mean decline in HbA1c levels was significantly different among the 3 groups (UC vs MC vs MPC: ‐0.49% vs ‐0.86% vs ‐1.04%; P=.02). The HbA1c level decreased in all groups; however, it did not differ among groups after 26 weeks. In a subgroup analysis, HbA1c levels showed a statistically significant decrease after the intervention in the MPC group compared with the change in the UC or MC group, especially in patients aged <65 years (P=.02), patients with a diabetes duration of ≥10 years (P=.02), patients with a BMI of ≥25.0 kg/m2 (P=.004), patients with a C‐peptide level of ≥0.6 ng/mL (P=.008), and patients who did not undergo treatment with insulin (P=.004) at 12 weeks. A total of 87.2% (137/157) of the participants were satisfied with the iCareD system. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth intervention for diabetes self‐care showed short‐term efficacy in glycemic control, and the effect decreased over time. The participants were comfortable with using the iCareD system and exhibited high adherence.

This study aimed to determine the clinical outcomes of patients using a novel tele‐monitoring system (OPTIMUM) as compared to the standard of care. METHODS: An open‐labelled randomised controlled trial involving 330 Asian patients with T2DM, aged 26‐65 years, and suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c = 7.5‐10%) was conducted in a Singapore public primary care clinic. The patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio by block randomization to the intervention group to receive: in‐app video‐based tele‐education, tele‐monitoring of the blood pressure (BP), capillary glucose and weight via Bluetooth devices and mobile application, followed by algorithm‐based tele‐management by the OPTIMUM telehealth care team for abnormal parameters. Patients received usual care in the control group. Clinical assessments and self‐care‐related questionnaires were administered for both groups at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Complete data of 159 (intervention) and 160 (control) patients with comparable demographic profiles were analysed.

A major contributor to poor outcomes is suboptimal diabetes management in pediatric patients and their families. The premise of this research project is that patients and families do not have adequate resources to meet the level of diabetes management that translates to better outcomes. Therefore, we will give them a valuable tool to improve their overall management. The tool is CareCoach. Research shows that enhancing communication and partnership among patients, parents, and providers is especially critical for optimal outcomes in pediatric diabetes. Communication gaps and conflict can complicate the already complex provider‐patient interactions and daily management. We have therefore designed, refined, and made available to consumers a new mobile‐based intervention, CareCoach, to improve communication; build trust among providers, patients and parents; and increase overall satisfaction with the quality of diabetes care. This web/mobile application is designed to help patients unobtrusively audiorecord their clinical encounters, track their medical consults and treatment plans, review information from past visits, create visit discussion guides, and track adherence to medication and dosing schedules. In addition, because mobile‐based applications are inexpensive to administer, portable, and available at all times of day, CareCoach holds great promise for communication coaching and contributing to improved diabetes management. We hypothesize that CareCoach will improve patient‐parent‐provider communications, build patient‐parent‐provider trust, and increase overall satisfaction with clinical interactions in a sample of children with type 1 diabetes and their parents. These improvements will lead to significant gains in diabetes management, setting the stage for optimal health outcomes.

Telehealth is an emerging field that can have a positive impact on the management of this disease. Aim: The aim was to study the impact of the frequency of consultation and follow‐up on telephone of diagnosed follow‐up patients of DM on glycemic and metabolic profiles, the patients’ compliance, and their quality of life (QoL), and to compare the effectiveness of different modes of follow‐up. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty patients were enrolled from the outpatient department (OPD) including both type 1 and type 2 DM patients who had already been diagnosed and were on treatment. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups, each consisting of 40 subjects, according to the mode of follow‐up: A (rare, i.e., less frequent outpatient visits), B (moderate, i.e., more frequent outpatient visits), and C (frequent, i.e., more frequent outpatient visits with weekly telephonic consultation). Metabolic profiles and the QoL were monitored. The patients’ compliance with and adherence to the treatment, and dietary and exercise advice were assessed. Results: The patients’ compliance with and adherence to the treatment was higher in group C, followed by groups B and A.

Patient‐level factors, such as diabetes knowledge, self‐management skills, empowerment, and perceived control, account for >90% of the variance observed in outcomes between these racial groups. There is strong evidence that self‐management interventions that include telephone‐delivered diabetes education and skills training are effective at improving metabolic control in diabetes. Web‐based home telemonitoring systems in conjunction with active care management are also effective ways to lower glycosylated hemoglobin A1c values when compared to standard care, and provide feedback to patients; however, there are no studies in African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM that examine the use of technology‐based feedback to tailor or augment diabetes education and skills training. This study provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature. METHODS: We describe an ongoing 4‐year randomized clinical trial, which will test the efficacy of a technology‐intensified diabetes education and skills training (TIDES) intervention in African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM. Two hundred male and female AfricanAmerican participants, 21 years of age or older and with a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c level ≥ 8%, will be randomized into one of two groups for 12 weeks of telephone interventions: (1) TIDES intervention group or (2) a usual‐care group. Participants will be followed for 12 months to ascertain the effect of the interventions on glycemic control. Our primary hypothesis is that, among African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM, patients randomized to the TIDES intervention will have significantly greater reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c at 12 months of follow‐up compared to the usual‐care group. DISCUSSION: Results from this study will add to the current literature examining how best to deliver diabetes education and skills training and provide important insight into effective strategies to improve metabolic control and hence reduce diabetes complications and mortality rates in African Americans with poorly controlled T2DM.

103,103,CN-02505826,"NCT05648383,",Promote Health With Digital Tools Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes/Prediabetes and/or Hypertension,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05648383,2022,"The rising burden of diabetes poses important public health challenges to health systems nowadays. The age‐standardized rates of diabetes prevalence have stabilized in many European countries in recent years, especially in the Nordic countries, but they have gone up in Southern, Eastern and Central EU countries. However, in the vast majority of countries, national diabetes plans are poorly (or not) implemented and underfunded and although T2D is preventable, its prevalence is expected to reach 66 million by 2030, and 68 million by 2045. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s ""Framework on integrated people‐centred health services"", integrated people‐centred health services put people and communities, not diseases, at the centre of health systems, and empower people to take charge of their own health rather than being passive recipients of services. People‐centred care is one of the main goals of health systems, and it is oriented towards the needs of people and their involvement in the treatment process and decision‐making. This is expected to result in better care as experienced by people, less inequality, health promotion, better disease prevention, and treatments targeted to people's needs. Health system transition to people‐centred care requires empowering citizens and integration of services. The growing digital transformation of health and care offers great opportunity to achieve this transition. Innovative solutions involving digital tools have the potential to improve people‐centred care through self‐management, goal orientation and shared decision‐making. The DigiCare4You project is in line with the WHO's conceptual framework, and is oriented to health promotion and disease prevention through empowering families and integrating care services in local communities to deliver people‐centred care for the prevention and management of T2D and HTN. Ultimately, the DigiCare4You project aims to involve high‐risk adults in the treatment process and decision‐making on personalized behavioral goals (e.g. diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, medication compliance) that meet their needs. The DigiCare4You project proposes a people‐centered health service model to prevent and manage T2D and HTN by using the existing resources and adding digital tools for empowering both the existing healthcare workforce and the healthcare recipients. The proposed model aims to integrate two fragmented primary care services, i.e., (a) the children's growth and development monitoring and (b) the early screening and prevention of T2D and HTN. The first one is implemented across all countries in Europe from birth through late adolescence, it includes a physical examination (eye, oral and hearing), anthropometric measurements (weight and height), vaccination evaluation and a brief family medical history, and it is usually linked with the school (primary and secondary education). The latter primary care service related to the screening and prevention of T2D and HTN among the adult population in Europe is poorly or not implemented at all despite the fact that the majority of European countries have made progress towards developing a national plan addressing diabetes specifically or in an overarching plan for non‐communicable diseases (NCDs). Integrating the existing children's' growth assessment procedure with the adult screening procedure for NCDs, can help identify and treat parents (and eventually families) at risk for T2D. Specifically, the proposed model, called DigiCare4You solution, consists of two core components: a) a two‐stage systematic screening procedure, and (b) a mHealth, community‐based intervention. The two‐stage screening procedure will be implemented using schools as the entry point to the community in order to reach as many parents with children at primary or secondary education as possible, and assess their risk for T2D and/or HTN. First, high risk parents will be identified through a digitalized non‐invasive screening procedure (1st stage screening), using a self‐reported questionnaire, the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC). Those parents with a FINDRISC ≥10 will be referred to glycaemia testing (i.e., fasting plasma glucose [FPG], and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) according to the national guidelines in each country) and blood pressure evaluation (2nd stage screening). Parents confirmed to have pre‐diabetes or diabetes will be invited to join the self‐management intervention including access to the DigiCare4You mHealth applications. The DigiCare4You mHealth applications will assist users make personalised decisions with respect to behavioral changes (e.g., diet tracking and meal planning, physical activity, sleep quantity), medication use (if applicable), scheduling/reminding re‐examination visits and prospectively monitoring their health outcomes. Last but not least, these applications will enable direct communication between the users and their healthcare providers through feedback messages and reports, including lab results. DigiCare4You acknowledges the differences in health and care systems across Europe and considering the vulnerable and underserved groups, will be adapted and implemented in two Middle‐income countries (MICs), Albania and Bulgaria, and two High‐income countries (HICs), Greece and Spain, all with high prevalence of T2D and HTN and weak primary healthcare systems. Furthermore, in all countries, both municipalities of medium‐high and low socioeconomic status (SES) areas (with low literacy levels, high rates of unemployment and large proportions of immigrants) will also be included. Overall, the DigiCare4You solution will ensure that even the most underserved parts of the community will be reached and any potential barrier towards achieving equal access for all will be tackled. This approach will allow the evaluation of the success and validity of the solution among MICs and HICs, and among the underserved and marginalized populations within countries. Therefore, if the DigiCare4You solution will be proven to be equally effective among high and low‐SES groups, this will ensure that the uptake of the solution at large scale will promote equity in health and easy access to primary healthcare services for the overall population. A hybrid II implementation study will be designed to implement and evaluate the DigiCare4You solution, comparing the mHealth intervention (intervention arm) with the existing standard care (control arm). In all four countries, a 1:1 cluster‐randomized design will be followed, randomly allocating municipalities (therefore the schools, the local community health centers and the families within each municipality) to either the intervention or the control arm. DigiCare4You intervention will have a two‐year duration and all measurements for the impact and outcome evaluation will take place at baseline and at 12‐ and 24‐months follow‐ups, while the process evaluation at participant, school and community level will be ongoing throughout the implementation period.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05648383,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucose Intolerance; Hypertension; Prediabetic State",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02505826/full,Hypertension,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Reasons for poor disease control include nonadherence, lack of patient engagement, and therapeutic inertia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact on clinic‐measured blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using a digital medicine offering (DMO) that measures medication ingestion adherence, physical activity, and rest using digital medicines (medication taken with ingestible sensor), wearable sensor patches, and a mobile device app. METHODS: Participants with elevated systolic BP (SBP ≥140 mm Hg) and HbA1c (≥7%) failing antihypertensive (≥2 medications) and oral diabetes therapy were enrolled in this three‐arm, 12‐week, cluster‐randomized study. Participants used DMO (includes digital medicines, the wearable sensor patch, and the mobile device app) for 4 or 12 weeks or received usual care based on site randomization. Providers in the DMO arms could review the DMO data via a Web portal. In all three arms, providers were instructed to make medical decisions (medication titration, adherence counseling, education, and lifestyle coaching) on all available clinical information at each visit. Primary outcome was change in SBP at week 4. Other outcomes included change in SBP and HbA1c at week 12, and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at weeks 4 and 12, as well as proportion of patients at BP goal (<140/90 mm Hg) at weeks 4 and 12, medical decisions, and medication adherence patterns. RESULTS: Final analysis included 109 participants (12 sites; age: mean 58.7, SD years; female: 49.5%, 54/109; Hispanic: 45.9%, 50/109; income ≤ US $20,000: 56.9%, 62/109; and ≤ high school education: 52.3%, 57/109). The DMO groups had 80 participants (7 sites) and usual care had 29 participants (5 sites). At week 4, DMO resulted in a statistically greater SBP reduction than usual care (mean ‐21.8, SE 1.5 mm Hg vs mean ‐12.7, SE 2.8 mmHg; mean difference ‐9.1, 95% CI ‐14.0 to ‐3.3 mm Hg) and maintained a greater reduction at week 12. The DMO groups had greater reductions in HbA1c, DBP, and LDL‐C, and a greater proportion of participants at BP goal at weeks 4 and 12 compared with usual care. The DMO groups also received more therapeutic interventions than usual care. Medication adherence was ≥80% while using the DMO. The most common adverse event was a self‐limited rash at the wearable sensor site (12%, 10/82). CONCLUSIONS: For patients failing hypertension and diabetes oral therapy, this DMO, which provides dose‐by‐dose feedback on medication ingestion adherence, can help lower BP, HbA1c, and LDL‐C, and promote patient engagement and provider decision making.

This system was modelled on a highly successful CSIRO platform that supports in‐home cardiac rehabilitation which resulted in improvements in adherence and clinical outcomes . This platform has been modified to enable real time monitoring of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes, and support patient care. The system comprises an app for iOS (Apple) and Android based smartphones, and a web‐based clinical portal. The mobile app enables participants to use a Bluetooth‐enabled glucose meter (AVIVA Connect, Roche) to automatically upload their BGL readings to the clinical portal. The mobile app also provides an insulin diary that allows participants to manually enter their insulin injections’ dose and time, along with free text comment for each dose (e.g. ""before dinner""). These data are subsequently transmitted and uploaded to the clinical portal via a mobile internet connection such as Wi‐Fi, 3G or 4G. The clinical portal presents the uploaded data in graphical and tabular formats, for the DNEs and endocrinologists to monitor and manage a patient's condition. Integrated alerts, which can be customised by clinicians, highlight out of range measures. Patients receive individual, computer generated alerts based on the frequency of BGL testing and BGL values. Individual patient screens enable a review of progress in advance of conventional outpatient encounters or in the course of telephone consultations. Through the portal, the clinicians can review the participants’ BGL data, insulin dosages, and send messages to the participants’ mobile phones. A summary of their diabetes care is also displayed based on the clinical information entered. Using the MRMS platform, an alternative model of outpatient service delivery has been designed at Princess Alexandra Hospital , which incorporates the following elements: 1. Short or long‐term monitoring of BGL, insulin dosage using the MRMS. 2. Targeting of intensive MRMS use to patients with suboptimal control. 3. Computer generated alerts sent to patient via text message. 4. Patient input before each clinic visit via online survey 5. Substitution of conventional in‐person follow‐up consultations with telephone or video‐consultations The participants will be followed up for 12 months.

The internet holds promise for programs that aim to improve adherence. We developed a computer‐tailored eHealth program for patients with T2DM to improve their treatment adherence, that is, adherence to both a healthy lifestyle and medical behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the eHealth program in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients with T2DM were recruited by their health professionals and randomized into either the intervention group, that is, access to the eHealth program for 6 months, or a waiting‐list control group. In total, 478 participants completed the baseline questionnaire, of which 234 gained access to the eHealth program. Of the 478 participants, 323 were male and 155 were female, the mean age was 60 years, and the participants had unfavorable BMI and HbA1c levels on average. Outcome data were collected through web‐based assessments on physical activity (PA) levels, caloric intake from unhealthy snacks, and adherence to oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) and insulin therapy. Changes to separate behaviors were standardized and summed into a composite change score representing changes in the overall treatment adherence. Further standardization of this composite change score yielded the primary outcome, which can be interpreted as Cohen d (effect size). Standardized change scores observed in separate behaviors acted as secondary outcomes. Mixed linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the effectiveness of the intervention on overall and separate treatment behavior adherence, accommodating relevant covariates and patient nesting. RESULTS: After the 6‐month follow‐up assessment, 47.4% (111/234) of participants in the intervention group and 72.5% (177/244) of participants in the control group were retained. The overall treatment adherence improved significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group, reflected by a small effect size (d=0.27; 95% CI 0.032 to 0.509; P=.03). When considering changes in separate treatment behaviors, a significant decrease was observed only in caloric intake from unhealthy snacks in comparison with the control group (d=0.36; 95% CI 0.136 to 0.584; P=.002). For adherence to PA (d=‐0.14; 95% CI ‐0.388 to 0.109; P=.27), OHAs (d=0.27; 95% CI ‐0.027 to 0.457; P=.08), and insulin therapy (d=0.35; 95% CI ‐0.066 to 0.773; P=.10), no significant changes were observed. These results from the unadjusted analyses were comparable with the results of the adjusted analyses, the per‐protocol analyses, and the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our multibehavior program significantly improved the overall treatment adherence compared with the control group. To further enhance the impact of the intervention in the personal, societal, and economic areas, a wide‐scale implementation of our eHealth intervention is suggested.

Controls used their current PN and did not use diabetes apps. Results: Fifty‐eight subjects were randomized. Fifty‐seven completed the study (intervention n = 27, control n = 30). At study end, there were no significant differences in PROs between groups, except improved medication adherence (ARMS‐D) in controls. From flash glucose monitoring (fGM) data, there were no significant differences in most glycemic measures between groups except for a trend for improved glycemic variability [mean amplitude of the glycemic excursions (MAGE)] in the Intervention (p = 0.06). Controls had significantly reduced time spent in hypoglycemia but had 2 to 3‐fold higher incidence at baseline. In general, Intervention subjects reported satisfaction with both the app and PN.

Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 77.9 mL/(min‧1.73 m2), and mean urine/albumin creatinine ratio was 88.6 mg/g. After 2 months, 69 of 200 (34.5%) patients received a new prescription for either SGLT2i or GLP1‐RA: 53.4% of patients in the Simultaneous arm and 8.3% of patients in the Education‐First arm (P<0.001). After 6 months, 128 of 200 (64.0%) received a new prescription: 69.8% of patients in the Simultaneous arm and 56.0% of patients in Education‐First (P<0.001). Patient self‐report of taking SGLT2i or GLP1‐RA within 6 months of trial entry was similarly greater in the Simultaneous versus Education‐First arm (69 of 116 [59.5%] versus 37 of 84 [44.0%]; P<0.001) Median time to first prescription was 24 (interquartile range [IQR], 13‐50) versus 85 days (IQR, 65‐106), respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, a remote, team‐based program identifies patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular or kidney risk, provides virtual education, prescribes SGLT2i or GLP1‐RA, and improves guideline‐directed medical therapy. These findings support greater utilization of virtual team‐based approaches to optimize chronic disease management.

The need for lifestyle modification and regular adherent treatment makes the management of the disease difficult. This study examines the scope of m‐Health in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in terms of glycemic control. Methods: A randomized controlled study was performed among the patients attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Mysuru city. A mobile application named DIAGURU, mainly focusing on lifestyle modification and medication management was used for a period of 6 months from April 2019 to September 2019 by 150 patients in the study group while another 150 participants served as controls. The change in glycosylated haemoglobin levels was assessed after six months. Results: The mean HbA1C levels at the starting of the study was found to be 7.36% ± 1.04 in the study group and 7.84% ± 1.33% in the control group. A repeat HbA1c test after six months showed a mean level of 7.10% ± 0.96% among the participants who received the intervention and 7.97% ± 1.37% among the control group. The values were showing a trend of reduction in the intervention group, with a median reduction HbA1c of −0.2% (−0.3% to −0.2%). Among the participants who did not receive our intervention, a median increase of 0.1% (0%–0.2%) in HbA1c was noticed. Mann Whitney U test was performed, and it showed a statistically significant association with a p value less than 0.001. Conclusion: From this study, we conclude that an intervention with a mobile application aimed at lifestyle modification and medication management in addition to regular medical treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients resulted in a better glycemic control compared to a control group who did not receive the adjuvant intervention.

To address non‐communicable diseases and the shortage of health workforce, the Rwandan Ministry of Health has introduced the home‐based care practitioners (HBCPs) programme: laypeople provide longitudinal care to chronic patients after receiving a six‐month training. Leveraging technological mobile solutions may also help improve health and healthcare. The D Rwanda study aims at: (a) determining the efficacy of an integrated programme for the management of diabetes in Rwanda, which will provide monthly patient assessments by HBCPs, and an educational and self‐management mHealth patient tool, and; (b) exploring qualitatively the ways the interventions will have been enacted, their challenges and effects, and changes in the patients' health behaviours and HBCPs' work satisfaction. Methods and analysis This is a mixed‐methods sequential explanatory study. First, there will be a one‐year cluster randomised controlled trial including two interventions ((1) HBCPs' programme; (2) HBCPs' programme + mobile health application) and usual care (control). Currently, nine hospitals run the HBCPs' programme. Under each hospital, administrative areas implementing the HBCPs' programme will be randomised to receive intervention 1 or 2. Eligible patients from each area will receive the same intervention. Areas without the HBCPs' programme will be assigned to the control group. The primary outcome will be changes in glycated haemoglobin. Secondary outcomes include medication adherence, mortality, complications, health‐related quality of life, diabetes‐related distress and health literacy. Second, at the end of the trial, focus group discussions will be conducted with patients and HBCPs. Financial support was received from the Karen Elise Jensens Fond, and the Universities of Aarhus and Luxembourg. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the Rwanda National Ethics Committee and the Ethics Review Panel of the University of Luxembourg.

We are conducting two randomised trials to evaluate the efficacy of text message‐based health messages in improving secondary coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention among patients with or without diabetes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Cardiovascular Health And Text Messaging (CHAT) Study and the CHAT‐Diabetes Mellitus (CHAT‐DM) Study are multicentre, single‐blind, randomised controlled trials of text messaging versus standard treatment with 6 months of follow‐up conducted in 37 hospitals throughout 17 provinces in China. The intervention group receives six text messages per week which target blood pressure control, medication adherence, physical activity, smoking cessation (when appropriate), glucose monitoring and lifestyle recommendations including diet (in CHAT‐DM). The text messages were developed based on behavioural change techniques, using models such as the information‐motivation‐behavioural skills model, goal setting and provision of social support. A total sample size of 800 patients would be adequate for CHAT Study and sample size of 500 patients would be adequate for the CHAT‐DM Study. In CHAT, the primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include a change in proportion of patients achieving a SBP <140 mm Hg, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), physical activity, medication adherence, body mass index (BMI) and smoking cessation. In CHAT‐DM, the primary outcome is the change in glycaemic haemoglobin (HbA1C) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include a change in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1C<7%, fasting blood glucose, SBP, LDL‐C, BMI, physical activity and medication adherence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The central ethics committee at the China National Center for Cardiovascular Disease and the Yale University Institutional Review Board approved the CHAT and CHAT‐DM studies.

Introduction: This study examined the effect of an educational intervention using WhatsApp® messaging on medication adherence of patients with hypertension and diabetes. Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed with 403 patients who had diabetes and/or hypertension and who had enrolled in the 33 Basic Health Units of Maringá‐PR, Brazil. The patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 203), which received usual care (multi‐professional educational appointments according to each Unit schedule) plus 55 audio, image or text WhatsApp messages about health care promotion, with an emphasis on medication adherence, or the control group. The control group (n = 200) only received usual care. Medication adherence, as measured by the Morisky‐Green Test, was compared through the chi‐square test after 16 weeks. Relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of effect size. Results: After the follow‐up period (4 months), 67.5% of the patients in the intervention group were adherent versus 58.5% in the control group (RR: 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 0.99‐1.34, p = 0.077). Discussion: Although the effect of the intervention was not statistically significant, there was a clinically significant impact associated with a 15% increase in medication adherence.

Evidence is mounting for the benefits of telemedicine in diabetes care, but remains limited on mobile‐health (m‐Health) interventions. INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the impact of an m‐Health diabetes platform on clinical outcomes, patient‐reported outcomes, patient and provider satisfaction, and app usage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open‐label, two‐arm parallel study enrolled 91 people at 3 sites in India, aged 18‐65, with type 2 diabetes, and an A1c between 7.5% and 12.5% (58‐113 mmol/mol). Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to m‐Health or usual care and observed for 6 months. All received free visits, laboratory tests, transportation fees, and strips and lancets. Intervention participants received the m‐Health app and a mobile phone data stipend. RESULTS: A1c change was previously reported as statistically significant. Significantly more participants in intervention than control had improved medication adherence (39.0% vs. 12.8%; p = 0.03) and increased frequency of blood glucose (BG) self‐testing (39.0% vs. 10.3%; p = 0.01) at 6 months from baseline. No other outcomes were significantly different. Among m‐Health users, 75% of participants actively used the app at week 24. Participants entered 29,668 medications and 2,575 BG readings, sent 497 messages, and received 890 messages. Most participants (80%) were satisfied with all aspects of the app and all seven providers rated the software very acceptable.

Plus the use of a mobile phone application (named ‘’My care Hub’’). The application is a software to be installed on participants mobile phones. It has both an android and i‐phone versions with comprehensive functionalities which includes; 1. Capacity for users to log and track their blood glucose readings, food intake and physical activity habits over time. 2. Analytical functions which aid presentation of recorded data in a graphical form. This will help participants to set their health care targets and monitor trends in their self‐care activities. 3. In response to the logged blood glucose reading, participants will receive automated personalized self‐care educational messages. Additionally, participants will also receive through the application, general educational, behavioural and motivational messages twice weekly for 12 months. All messages will deliver information on the seven essential self‐care behaviours in people with diabetes which predict good outcomes namely; lifestyle modifications (healthy eating and improved physical activity), monitoring of blood sugar, compliance with medications, good problem‐solving skills, healthy coping skills, and risk‐reduction behaviours (such as smoking caseation and reduction in alcohol intake). Compilation of both the personalized and general messages is by a Diabetes Educator and an Endocrinologist with over 7 years experience in the management of people with diabetes. To access how best the application works for participants, they will be asked to input those self‐care measurements at least twice a week; once on a weekend and once during the weekdays. The measurements inputted into the application will be automatically sent to the principal investigator through a secured web interface and stored onto a pass‐worded protected computer system in an aggregated de‐identified format. This will be used to monitor adherence to the use of the intervention. Orientation and support for the use of the application will involve the following: 1. At the start of the trial, face to face training will be provided by the principal investigator to the participants. 2.. The principal investigator will contact the participants at least twice within the first month to inquire about any problem with the use of the application. We believe this period will be sufficient for them to get acquainted with the application. 3. At the start of the study, participants will be provided with the phone number and email address of the principal investigator whom they can contact for issues pertaining to the use of the application. This technical support will be available to participants throughout the study period. CONDITION: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus SECONDARY OUTCOME: Change in Self Perceived Quality of Life will be measured using the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL‐8D) questionnaire. AQol‐8D is a 35 item instrument with domains to measure the physical, mental and social dimensions of health, as well as health utilities index and quality of well‐being. AQol‐8D is a comprehensive instrument with high validity and reliability (Richardson et al., 2013). Change in knowledge of Diabetes management will be measured using the revised Michigan Diabetes Knowledge Scale (DKT). INCLUSION CRITERIA: ‐ Diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes ‐ Using insulin therapy with or without oral medication ‐ Own a smart phone (either android or IOS operation system) ‐ Consent from patient to participate ‐ Willing to return for follow up at 4, 8 and 12 months post intervention PRIMARY OUTCOME: Change in Glycosylated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c). HbA1c is an important measure of long‐term glycemic control having the ability to reflect the cumulative glycemic history of the preceding 2‐3 months (Khan & Weinstock, 2011). HbA1C test is done through a laboratory test of venous blood sample using the Siemens/Bayer DCA 2000 Analyser. This test is requested by the patient’s health care practitioner as part of usual care, so there will be a retrospective collection of this measure from the clinical records at each data collection point (baseline, 4,8 and 12 monthly). Change in Lipids levels. A participant’s lipid profile is important because lipid abnormalities and diabetes often co‐exist, so there will investigation of impact of variations in glycemic control on lipid schemes of participants. Lipid measurement is part of the usual care for diabetes patients and done through a laboratory procedure using a lipid profile Analyser.. Data collection will be through a retrospective check of the clinical records at each data collection point (baseline, 4, 8 and 12 monthly). Change in Urine Albumin to Creatinine ratio (ACR): ACR is an accurate test to identify any abnormal amounts of albumin in urine and it plays a central role in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control and the progression of tissue damage. ACR is measured in the laboratory using the Siemens/Bayer DCA 2000 Analyser and is part of the routine care test requested by the patient’s health care practitioner. Data collection will be through a retrospective these measures from the clinical records at each data collection point (baseline, 4, 8 and 12 monthly). ; DKT (comprises of 20 items) is designed to assess patient knowledge of diabetes concerning blood glucose levels and testing, diet, exercise, and self‐care activities. DKT has been shown as a reliable and valid instrument to measure patient’s general knowledge of diabetes (Collins et al 2010). Change in medication adherence will be measured using the Medication Adherence Scale (MAQ). MAQ is a short 10 item questionnaire to study medication taking behaviour. It has been reported as an easy to score tool adaptable for various groups to identify barriers to adherence with medication intake (Culig & Leppee, 2014). Cost effectiveness of the intervention: Direct cost of implementing the intervention such as cost of personnel, operating cost, maintenance cost, and capital costs will be computed. As well as cost of hospital visits due to emergency (acute) complications (if any) as well as predicted long term health care cost incurred related to chronic complication development (if any). Indirect health cost will entail transportation to clinic appointments as a result of emergency complications and loss of productivity from being absent from work or usual activity due to such complication. Cost for standard care will also be elucidated for comparative cost analysis Engagement with intervention. This will be computed from the number of logs of blood glucose, diet and physical activity entered into the mobile application by the participants. The Diabetes Self‐Management Questionnaire (DSMQ) will be used to assess change ; in diabetes self‐care activities associated with glycemic control. DSMQ is a 20 item questionnaire with four major subscales; Physical activity, dietary control, glucose management and health care use. Research has provided evidence that DSMQ is a reliable and valid measure for self‐management in people with diabetes (Schmitt et al., 2013) The family history of diabetes and co‐morbidities that may be present in the participants or in their paternal and maternal side will be elucidated.

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ""seeing"" versus ""not seeing"" medication dose reminders regarding medication adherence and risk for overdose. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient setting. Adult subjects (18 years of age or older) with uncontrolled hypertension and DM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects enrolled in this institutional review board‐approved study were assigned to either use digital health (DH) with the use of sensor‐enabled medicines (coencapsulated medicines with an ingestible sensor) for 4 or 12 weeks or receive usual care based on a cluster‐randomized design. All subjects were followed for 12 weeks. Subjects using DH were included in the post hoc study consisting of an efficacy analysis and a safety analysis. A main efficacy outcome of comparison of subjects taking medicine with or without ""seeing"" DH medication dose reminders was assessed. Safety analysis assessed risk of overdosing after DH medication dose reminders. RESULTS: In 57 subjects included in the efficacy analysis, DH device reminder messages were associated with a 16 ± 16% increase (75 ± 18% when seeing vs. 59 ± 24% when not seeing mobile dose reminders) in medication taking if not taken before dose reminder. The mean overall adherence for all subjects was 86 ± 12%; the mean on‐time adherence was 69.7 ± 19.7%. Subjects with lower adherence benefited more from seeing DH reminder messages. In the safety study (n = 74 subjects and 24,426 medication ingestions), no events of overdoses related to DH medication dose reminders occurred.

This system is modelled on a highly successful CSIRO platform that supports in home cardiac rehabilitation leading to improvements in adherence and clinical outcomes . This system has been modified to enable real time monitoring of BGL in patients with diabetes, and to support patient care. The system comprises an app for iOS‐ (Apple) and Android‐based smartphones, and a web‐based clinical portal. The mobile app enables patients to use a Bluetooth‐enabled glucose meter (Accu‐Chek® Aviva Guide, Roche Diagnostics GmbH) to upload their BGL readings to the clinical portal. The mobile app also provides an insulin diary that allows patients to manually enter the dose and time of their insulin injections, along with a free text comment for each dose (e.g. ""before dinner""). These data are subsequently transmitted and uploaded to the clinical portal via the internet. The clinical portal presents the uploaded data in graphical and tabular formats for the CDEs and endocrinologists to monitor and manage a patient's condition. Integrated alerts, which can be customised by clinicians, highlight out of range measures. Through the portal, the clinicians can review the patients’ BGL data and insulin dosages, and send messages to the patients’ mobile phones. A summary of their diabetes care is also displayed based on the clinical information entered. Patients receive optional automated individual text‐messages based on frequency of BGL testing and BGL values. These messages serve as prompts to test BGL as recommended, consider reasons for out of range BGL measures and to seek medical advice if required. The messages also contain links to national diabetes website for additional information regarding self‐management of diabetes. Mobile app screens enable a review of progress. We obtained patient and clinician feedback on the MDMS through a proof of concept trial with diabetes patients who had stable glycaemic management. This enabled enhancements to the MDMS. The management of the intervention group will use the MDMS as described earlier for insulin dose adjustments. CONDITION: Type 2 diabetes PRIMARY OUTCOME: Change in HbA1c.

Few interventions, however, have been developed specifically for this age group. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized trial, we will provide a mobile app (SweetGoals) to all participants as a ""core"" intervention. The app prompts participants to upload data from their diabetes devices weekly to a device‐agnostic uploader (Glooko), automatically retrieves uploaded data, assesses daily and weekly self‐management goals, and generates feedback messages about goal attainment. Further, the trial will test two unique intervention components: (1) incentives to promote consistent daily adherence to goals, and (2) web health coaching to teach effective problem solving focused on personalized barriers to self‐management. We will use a novel digital direct‐to‐patient recruitment method and intervention delivery model that transcends the clinic. METHODS: A 2x2 factorial randomized trial will be conducted with 300 young adults ages 19‐25 with type 1 diabetes and (Hb)A1c = 8.0%. All participants will receive the SweetGoals app that tracks and provides feedback about two adherence targets: (a) daily glucose monitoring; and (b) mealtime behaviors. Participants will be randomized to the factorial combination of incentives and health coaching. The intervention will last 6 months. The primary outcome will be reduction in A1c. Secondary outcomes include self‐regulation mechanisms in longitudinal mediation models and engagement metrics as a predictor of outcomes. Participants will complete 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up assessments. We hypothesize greater sustained A1c improvements in participants who receive coaching and who receive incentives compared to those who do not receive those components. RESULTS: Data collection is expected to be complete by February 2025. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes are expected by December 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Successful completion of these aims will support dissemination and effectiveness studies of this intervention that seeks to improve glycemic control in this high‐risk and understudied population of young adults with T1D.

Interventions have previously been developed to improve medication adherence, but inconsistent outcomes have been reported. A potential explanation for this inconsistency is a 'one size fits all' approach, with interventions not tailored to the needs and preferences of individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalised intervention programme aimed at improving adherence to oral antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive medication in people with T2DM. METHODS: A parallel‐group randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 40‐50 community pharmacies in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK). A total of 300 participants will be included and followed up for a period of 6 months. Participants will be people with T2DM identified as non‐adherent to oral antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive medication, aged 35‐75 years and mobile phone users. The intervention group will receive a personalised intervention programme that is based on one or more of the participants' pre‐defined non‐adherence profile(s), namely (I) Knowledge and perceptions, (II) Practical problems, (III) Side effects and (IV) Negative mood and beliefs. The intervention comprises of one or more supporting modules, namely (I) Brief messaging, (II) Clinical medication review, (III) Medication schedule, (IV) Reminding messaging, (V) Medication dispensing systems, (VI) Smart messaging, (VII) Referral to general practitioner and (VIII) Unguided web‐based Self Help Application for low mood. The control group will receive usual care including access to a publicly available informative diabetes website. The primary study outcome is medication adherence measured with a telephone pill count. Secondary outcomes are systolic blood pressure, HbA1c level, self‐reported medication adherence, attitude and beliefs toward medication, satisfaction with diabetes treatment, health status and medical consumption and productivity cost. In addition, a process evaluation will be undertaken to establish the fidelity, reach and the extent to which intervention delivery is normalised in the daily practice of community pharmacy teams. DISCUSSION: The study can lead to a personalised intervention programme that improves medication adherence in people with T2DM that are non‐adherent to oral antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive medication.

Digital storytelling interventions are narrative‐based videos elicited through a community‐based participatory research approach to surface the authentic voices of participants overcoming obstacles to health‐promoting behaviors that perpetuate health inequities; research on the effect of digital storytelling on T2D outcomes among Hispanic adults is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a digital storytelling intervention on glycemic control and its acceptability among Hispanic patients with poorly controlled T2D. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted within 2 primary care networks in Minnesota and Arizona among Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D (hemoglobin A1c level ≥8%). Enrollment and follow‐up were conducted between February 14, 2019, and November 1, 2023. INTERVENTION: The intervention group viewed a 12‐minute digital storytelling video. The video included 4 Spanish‐language stories that reinforced 4 diabetes self‐management behavioral goals (healthful diet for diabetes, physical activity, medication adherence, and glucose self‐monitoring). The control group received printed, culturally tailored T2D education materials. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 3 months for hemoglobin A1c levels, adjusting for baseline hemoglobin A1c, age, gender, education, and income. Acceptability and narrative quality of the intervention were assessed through questionnaires. RESULTS: There were 451 study participants, with 227 (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [9.3] years; 158 [69.3%] women) randomized to the intervention group and 224 (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [9.1] years; 156 [69.3%] women) to the control group. Of these, 390 completed 3‐month follow‐up of the primary outcome (86% retention). There was a small improvement in the mean (SD) hemoglobin A1c level in the intervention group compared with the control group in the adjusted model (9.1% [1.7] to 8.4% [1.6] vs 9.4% [1.8] to 8.8% [2.0]; P = .04] but not in the unadjusted model. Acceptability and narrative quality of the intervention were high. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, a digital storytelling intervention developed with and for Hispanic adults with T2D was highly acceptable and feasibly implemented within primary care settings and resulted in a modest improvement of glycemic control. This was a highly scalable intervention that may be integrated into clinical practice as part of a longitudinal diabetes self‐management program for Hispanic adults.

Poor healthcare access and cultural barriers prevent optimal care, adherence, and clinical benefit, thus placing Hispanics at high risk for costly diabetes complications. The investigators' established academic‐healthcare‐community partnership has unique experience in developing and testing innovative, cost‐effective, and sustainable chronic care interventions to reduce disparities and improve health in underserved communities. The investigators recently developed Dulce Digital (i.e., ""one‐size‐fits‐all"" educational text messages, with nurse monitoring of patient‐transmitted blood glucose values), which improved glycemic control across 6 months, relative to usual care in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of N=126 Hispanic patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The process evaluation for this trial indicated that Dulce Digital was both feasible and acceptable from patient and provider perspectives; however, patients expressed a preference for a more individualized intervention, and providers requested an even greater focus on health behavior change. Thus, the proposed RCT will examine the comparative effectiveness of Dulce Digital versus ""Dulce Digital‐Me"" (DD‐Me) in N=414 Hispanic adults of low SES with poorly controlled T2DM from Neighborhood Healthcare, a San Diego Federally‐Qualified Health Center. Guided by patient and provider feedback, DD‐Me includes Dulce Digital components plus personalized goal‐setting and feedback that is responsive to the individual's needs and preferences. The DD‐Me adaptive feedback component will be informed by the Resources and Support for Self‐Management Model and Operant Conditioning Theory, and based on the individual's progress on intermediate behavioral targets (i.e., medication adherence assessed by wireless sensor; brief mobile phone‐based assessments of diet, physical activity, stress). Feedback will be delivered via algorithm‐driven automated messaging in 50% of DD‐Me participants and by the care team medical assistant in the remaining half to determine the feasibility and acceptability (given the purported cultural relevance of interpersonal relationships in the Hispanic culture), and the comparative effectiveness and cost of each delivery method. Changes in indicators of diabetes clinical control [i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), systolic blood pressure (SBP)], patient‐provider communication, and patient adherence (i.e., to medication and other diabetes self‐management behaviors) will be evaluated across twelve months. Thorough process and cost‐effectiveness analyses will evaluate the scalability and sustainability potential of DD‐Me.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Project Dulce model, with and without wireless technology, on glycemic control and other clinical and self‐reported outcomes in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Mexico. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adults with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of ≥8% were recruited from Family Medical Unit #27 of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Tijuana, México, and randomly assigned to one of three groups: Project Dulce‐only (PD); Project Dulce technology‐enhanced with mobile tools (PD‐TE); or IMSS standard of care/control group (CG). Clinical and self‐reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, Month 4, and Month 10. Time‐by‐group interactions and within‐group changes were analyzed. RESULTS: HbA1c reductions from baseline to Month 10 were significantly greater in PD‐TE (‐3.0% [‐33 mmol/mol]) and PD (‐2.6% [‐28.7 mmol/mol]) compared with CG (‐1.3% [‐14.2 mmol/mol]) (P = 0.009 and 0.001, respectively). PD‐TE and PD also exhibited significant improvement in diabetes knowledge when compared with CG (P < 0.05 for both). No statistically significant differences were detected between PD and PD‐TE on these indicators (P = 0.54 and 0.86, respectively). Several within‐group improvements were observed on other clinical and self‐report indicators but did not vary significantly across groups.

HbA1c will be measured at baseline, 3‐month, 6‐month, 9‐month, and 12‐month follow‐up visits in all participants. The main analysis will be based on the intention‐to‐treat principle. The primary endpoint of the study will be the change in HbA1C within the groups and the differences between the groups. This will be assessed by a repeated measurement approach based on mixed models which contain both fixed effects and random effects. Discussion: The overall goal of this project is to contribute to the evidence for the use of mobile technology to improve the treatment and regulation of poorly controlled DM2 patients living in Mexico. Our proposed project will show how mobile health technology tools can be used in the treatment of patients with uncontrolled DM2 in primary health care in a Latin American population, and particularly how they could help diabetes patients take better care of themselves.

OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes between community health worker use of a tailored, interactive, Web‐based, tablet computer‐delivered tool (iDecide) and use of print educational materials. DESIGN: Randomized, 2‐group trial conducted from 2011 to 2013 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01427660). SETTING: Community health center in Detroit, Michigan, serving a Latino and African American low‐income population. PARTICIPANTS: 188 adults with a hemoglobin A1c value greater than 7.5% (55%) or those who reported questions, concerns, or difficulty taking diabetes medications. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 1‐ to 2‐hour session with a community health worker who used iDecide or printed educational materials and 2 follow‐up calls. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were changes in knowledge about antihyperglycemic medications, patient‐reported medication decisional conflict, and satisfaction with antihyperglycemic medication information. Also examined were changes in diabetes distress, self‐efficacy, medication adherence, and hemoglobin A1c values. RESULTS: Ninety‐four percent of participants completed 3‐month follow‐up. Both groups improved across most measures. iDecide participants reported greater improvements in satisfaction with medication information (helpfulness, P = 0.007; clarity, P = 0.03) and in diabetes distress compared with the print materials group (P < 0.001). The other outcomes did not differ between the groups. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted at 1 health center during a short period. The community health workers were experienced in behavioral counseling, thereby possibly mitigating the need for additional support tools. CONCLUSION: Most outcomes were similarly improved among participants receiving both types of decision‐making support for diabetes medication. Longer‐term evaluations are necessary to determine whether the greater improvements in satisfaction with medication information and diabetes distress achieved in the iDecide group at 3 months translate into better longer‐term diabetes outcomes.

Long‐term glycemic control is important to prevent or delay the onset of DM related complications. Patients often fail to achieve optimal glycemic control from pharmacotherapy due to non‐adherence. With the high prevalence of smartphone usage locally and among the developed countries, there has been a growing interest to deliver interventions through mobile applications. In this study, a mobile application targeted at improving medication adherence among people with Type 2 DM will be developed and evaluated. Aims: This study aims to (i) design a smartphone application to improve medication adherence and (ii) evaluate its impact on clinical outcomes, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status among patients with Type 2 DM. Hypothesis: The use of a smartphone application can improve medication adherence among patients with Type 2 DM, as well as clinical outcomes, HRQoL and health status. Methods: This is a randomized, open‐label controlled trial involving patients with Type 2 DM managed at Singapore General Hospital. Patients seen at the institution's Diabetes Centre and those referred to the pharmacist‐led Medication Therapy Management service are eligible to participate. Patients in the intervention group will have the mobile application downloaded onto their smartphones, while those in the control group will receive the usual standard of care. The primary outcome will be change in self‐reported medication adherence, determined using the 8‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in HbA1c, blood glucose, frequency of dose titrations, addition or removal of oral hypoglycemic agents, HRQoL (measured using the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life) and health status (measured using the EuroQol‐5D‐5L and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale). All outcomes will be measured at baseline and at the end of the 6‐month study period (± 4 weeks).

These people will be identified by the personâ€™s GP practice who will search their records to find patients who have not ordered enough of their medication to allow them to be able to take them as prescribed over the previous 2 years. These people will get an invitation letter, participant information leaflet and an expression of interest form. The medical practice will send one reminder after 2 weeks. If a patient is interested, they will then contact their community pharmacy team by telephone or in person. Eligible participants may also be approached opportunistically by the practice team members when visiting the GP to check whether they received the letter sent by the practice and encourage them to notify their regular pharmacy if interested in the study. The community pharmacy team will be trained by the researchers so that they know what to do when approached by a patient expressing interest in study participation. The pharmacy team will also opportunistically approach potential participants who contacts the pharmacy of whether they received the study invitation letter from their GPs and whether they would like to participate. A trained member of the community pharmacy team will ask the patient some questions to make sure that they are definitely right for the project for example, they must have a mobile phone that allows them to get text messages.

Nonetheless, few studies have assessed the cost‐effectiveness of telemonitoring for the self‐management of diabetes based on real‐world data. Methods: A randomized controlled trial entitled Optimizing care of Patients via Telehealth In Monitoring and Augmenting their control of Diabetes Mellitus was conducted among adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Singapore. Individuals in the intervention group (n = 159) underwent a telemonitoring program comprising of remote patient monitoring, education, individualized health coaching, and teleconsultations, whereas individuals in the control group (n = 160) received regular care. Economic evaluation was conducted from health care system and societal perspectives in 2020 in Singapore dollars, using health outcomes and costs documented at baseline and at 6 month follow‐up. One‐way sensitivity analyses and bootstrapping to generate scatter plot on cost‐effectiveness planes were done. Results: The adjusted reduction in HbA1c scores was greater in the intervention group by ‐0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], ‐0.65 to ‐0.17), while the change in utility scores was higher in the intervention group by 0.011 (95% CI, ‐0.016 to 0.0378). From a health care perspective, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the telemonitoring program per unit improvement in HbA1c, per additional case of well‐controlled diabetes, and per unit improvement in quality adjusted life years was SGD 580.44, SGD 9100.15, and SGD 21,476.36, respectively. From a societal perspective, the ICERs were SGD 817.20, SGD 12,812.02, and SGD 30,236.36, respectively.

Patients with both HF and DM are at higher risk of adverse cardiovascular and HF outcomes than those with either disease in isolation. Different antihyperglycemic medications (even within the same medication class) have conflicting results of benefit or harm in patients with established and incident HF. Recent data highlight the importance of a renewed focus on optimal pharmacotherapy for this population with DM and HF (or at risk for HF). Both HF and DM require major lifestyle modification for optimal management, in terms of both optimizing health behaviors (eg, physical activity, diet) and adherence to complex medical and self‐care regimens. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies (eg, apps, wearables) are widely available in the community and may play a role in optimizing the health status of patients; however, there is limited and conflicting information on whether such technologies are actually beneficial in at‐risk populations.

We sought to explore if efficacious interventions that improve glycemic control may also have potential to reduce CKD progression. METHODS: REACH is a text message‐delivered self‐management support intervention, which focused on medication adherence, diet, and exercise that significantly improved glycemic control in N = 506 patients with T2D. Using data from the trial, we characterized kidney health in the full sample and explored the intervention's effect on change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months in a subsample of N=271 patients with eGFR data. RESULTS: In a diverse sample with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, 37.2% had presence of mild or heavy proteinuria and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. There was a trending interaction effect between intervention and presence of proteinuria at baseline (b = 6.016, p = .099) such that patients with proteinuria at baseline who received REACH had less worsening of eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should examine whether diabetes directed self‐management support reduces CKD progression in ethnically diverse individuals with albuminuria. In highly comorbid populations, such as T2D and CKD, text‐based support can be further tailored according to individuals' multimorbid disease self‐management needs and is readily scalable for individuals with limited resources.

Most patients receive suboptimal doses and do not achieve glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a voice‐based conversational artificial intelligence (AI) application can help patients with type 2 diabetes titrate basal insulin at home to achieve rapid glycemic control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 primary care clinics at an academic medical center from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, 32 adults with type 2 diabetes requiring initiation or adjustment of once‐daily basal insulin were followed up for 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed from January to February 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive basal insulin management with a voice‐based conversational AI application or standard of care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were time to optimal insulin dose (number of days needed to achieve glycemic control), insulin adherence, and change in composite survey scores measuring diabetes‐related emotional distress and attitudes toward health technology and medication adherence. Secondary outcomes were glycemic control and glycemic improvement. Analysis was performed on an intent‐to‐treat basis. RESULTS: The study population included 32 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.1 [12.7] years; 19 women [59.4%]). Participants in the voice‐based conversational AI group more quickly achieved optimal insulin dosing compared with the standard of care group (median, 15 days [IQR, 6‐27 days] vs >56 days [IQR, >29.5 to >56 days]; a significant difference in time‐to‐event curves; P = .006) and had better insulin adherence (mean [SD], 82.9% [20.6%] vs 50.2% [43.0%]; difference, 32.7% [95% CI, 8.0%‐57.4%]; P = .01). Participants in the voice‐based conversational AI group were also more likely than those in the standard of care group to achieve glycemic control (13 of 16 [81.3%; 95% CI, 53.7%‐95.0%] vs 4 of 16 [25.0%; 95% CI, 8.3%‐52.6%]; difference, 56.3% [95% CI, 21.4%‐91.1%]; P = .005) and glycemic improvement, as measured by change in mean (SD) fasting blood glucose level (‐45.9 [45.9] mg/dL [95% CI, ‐70.4 to ‐21.5 mg/dL] vs 23.0 [54.7] mg/dL [95% CI, ‐8.6 to 54.6 mg/dL]; difference, ‐68.9 mg/dL [95% CI, ‐107.1 to ‐30.7 mg/dL]; P = .001). There was a significant difference between the voice‐based conversational AI group and the standard of care group in change in composite survey scores measuring diabetes‐related emotional distress (‐1.9 points vs 1.7 points; difference, ‐3.6 points [95% CI, ‐6.8 to ‐0.4 points]; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of a voice‐based conversational AI application that provided autonomous basal insulin management for adults with type 2 diabetes, participants in the AI group had significantly improved time to optimal insulin dose, insulin adherence, glycemic control, and diabetes‐related emotional distress compared with those in the standard of care group. These findings suggest that voice‐based digital health solutions can be useful for medication titration.

One in three Singaporeans has a lifetime risk of getting diabetes and the number of those with diabetes is projected to reach one million by 2050, if current trends continue. Life years lost due to mortality and ill‐health related to diabetes was the 4th largest among all diseases in 2010 while the cost burden from diabetes, including medical expenses and productivity loss, was expected to rise from beyond $940 million in 2014 to $1.8 billion in 2050. In addition, every year in Singapore, 2 in 3 new kidney failure cases are due to diabetes, and 1 in 2 people who suffer from a heart attack had co‐existing diabetes. Tele‐health projects have been conducted successfully overseas on patients suffering from diabetes. Telehealth refers to the systematic provision of healthcare services over physically separate environments via Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and distinguishes between four main dimensions/ domains of Telemedicine as follow: 1. Tele‐collaboration, which refers to interactions between (facility‐based or mobile) onsite and remote healthcare professionals for clinical purposes e.g. referral, co‐diagnosis, supervision or case review. The distinguishing feature is that healthcare professionals are involved at both ends of the interaction and a patient may or may not be involved in the same Telemedicine interaction. 2. Tele‐treatment, which refers to interactions between remote healthcare professionals and patients/ caregivers for the purposes of direct clinical care. The distinguishing feature is that a patient or caregiver is involved directly at one end of the interaction and this creates (or presupposes the existence of) a professional‐patient relationship. Tele‐treatment is used in the remote delivery of primary care and many forms of speciality care. 3. Tele‐monitoring, which refers to biomedical and other forms of data collection directly from patients (or through caregivers) by remote systems, which are used by healthcare professionals for clinical purposes such as vital signs monitoring and home nursing. Tele‐monitoring is used in remote chronic disease management. The distinguishing feature is that a healthcare professional or organisation is engaged at one end. Another feature of Tele‐monitoring is that it need not create (or presuppose the existence of) a professional‐patient relationship even though the healthcare organisation as a whole might ow a duty of care to the patient. 4. Tele‐support, which refers to the use of online services for non‐clinical (ie educational and administrative) purposes to support the patient, and caregiver. The ""More Independent"" programme run by Philips and the Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) provided telehealth services for 1,808 patients recruited from the primary care setting in Liverpool. The study showed reductions in emergency admissions and secondary care costs (in comparison with the control group) ranging from 22% to 32% for patients with above average risk (25% or more). Patient reported outcomes (PRO) also show that 90% of patients feel more in control, have gained confidence and/or feel better able to cope with their condition. However, there has been no such large scale study done in Singapore to study the impact of telehealth on the disease progression, healthcare utilisation and cost of care for diabetic patients in the primary care setting. As such, an evaluation of a prospective telehealth programme, i.e. Optimizing care of Patients via Telehealth In Monitoring and Augmenting their control of Diabetes Mellitus (OPTIMUM) is being planned for in SingHealth Polyclinics. The current standard of care comprises on‐site measurements of clinical parameters and education in a usual outpatient clinic setting. The telehealth programme comprises remote patient monitoring, education, individualised on‐line health coaching and timely interventions provided by primary healthcare professionals in polyclinics. The proposed Philips VitalHealth solution incorporates telehealth‐enabled chronic disease management and care coordination. The telehealth‐enabled chronic disease management programme is customised for individuals with chronic diseases and aims to provide timely intervention to prevent disease deterioration, increase compliance to treatment regimen (e.g. medication), and most importantly, engage participants to better manage their own care. On the insurance front, there are many ""gaps"" present in the insurance industry today with regard to chronic diseases, and to this end, Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) is interested to jointly study the effectiveness of a telehealth programme on diabetic patients, so that they can develop new health insurance products that can meet that insurance gap.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04306770,,,Trial registry record,Diabetes Mellitus,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02089033/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Enthusiasm for CVT is especially high in the VA given geographical separation between many Veterans and their providers at VA Medical Centers. However, because CVT encounters are by nature less personal than in‐person visits, communication during CVT visits may be more challenging for both patients and providers resulting in less patient‐centered communication. Less personal visits may have less exchange of information, lower satisfaction, less trust, and poorer outcomes. Indeed, research comparing CVT with in‐person consultations found that patients in CVT visits were more passive and that CVT interactions were dominated by providers when compared with in‐person visits. This project will leverage prior work from two HSR&D‐funded pilot projects to improve provider ‐ patient communication for Veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a short‐term project, SHP‐08‐182, the investigators conducted focus groups to elicit and understand patients' barriers to communicating with their providers. This qualitative work was used in a subsequent pilot project, PPO‐08‐402 to develop an educational video to encourage Veterans to use active participatory communication in their visits to providers. This work was successfully completed and the product is a 10‐minute video that, in testing, was found to be acceptable and feasible to show to VA patients immediately preceding their medical encounters. Objectives: The investigators goal in this project is develop and test a video intervention and to also develop pamphlets for patients and providers to encourage active and positive communication in CVT medical interactions. The investigators goal was developed with and is supported by the project's operational partner the Office of Telehealth Services and is integral to the goal to ensure patient‐centered care in new models of care. Patient‐centered communication in medical interactions is critical and plays an important, but often overlooked, role in the delivery of health services. There are two aims. First, the investigators will develop educational interventions to encourage patients and providers to use active communication behaviors during CVT visits. Second, the investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the video and pamphlet (intervention) vs. pamphlet alone (comparison) in a two‐arm randomized effectiveness trial. The investigators will evaluate for improvement in visit outcomes including patient and provider measures of patient‐centered care and communication, reduction in several common barriers to clinical improvement, and improved medication adherence measures and hemoglobin A1c. In addition, the investigators will assess the mediators and moderators of the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes. Methods: The project will have two phases. In the initial phase of the proposed project the investigators will develop the video intervention. Video development will include qualitative interviews with stakeholders and patients regarding CVT barriers and perceived benefits. The investigators will use several existing resources and an expert panel of co‐investigators and consultants to bring these elements together and produce the intervention. In phase 2 the investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the intervention, evaluating for improvement in a number of outcomes. Impacts: The educational tools will be deliverables that could be used prior to CVT visits to improve communication and could serve as a paradigm for developing communication aids for other medical conditions and other clinical settings. The investigators will evaluate whether the educational intervention will help improve communication and will be associated with better visit and intermediate outcomes. Educational tools that encourage more patient‐centered communication during CVT encounters may allow more rapid acceptance of CVT, thereby improving access to healthcare and enhancing the operational mission of the project's partner.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT02522494,,,Trial registry record,Diabetes Mellitus,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01491481/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

However, numerous psychosocial and environmental barriers to adherence prevent low‐income, urban, and ethnic minority populations from achieving their management goals, resulting in diabetes complications. Health coaches working with clinical pharmacists represent a promising strategy for addressing common diabetes management barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) tools may further enhance their ability to support vulnerable minority populations in diabetes management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of an mHealth clinical pharmacist and health coach‐delivered intervention on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, primary outcome), blood pressure, and low‐density lipoprotein (secondary outcomes) in African‐Americans and Latinos with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A 2‐year, randomized controlled crossover study will evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes intervention delivered by a health coach and clinical pharmacist team compared with usual care. All patients will receive 1 year of team intervention, including lifestyle and medication support delivered in the home with videoconferencing and text messages. All patients will also receive 1 year of usual care without team intervention and no home visits. The order of the conditions received will be randomized. Our recruitment goal is 220 urban African‐American or Latino adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c ≥8%) receiving care from a largely minority‐serving, urban academic medical center. The intervention includes the following: health coaches supporting patients through home visits, phone calls, and text messaging and clinical pharmacists supporting patients through videoconferences facilitated by health coaches. Data collection includes physiologic (HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, and lipid profile) and survey measures (medication adherence, diabetes‐related behaviors, and quality of life). Data collection during the second year of study will determine the maintenance of any physiological improvement among participants receiving the intervention during the first year. RESULTS: Participant enrollment began in March 2017. We have recruited 221 patients. Intervention delivery and data collection will continue until November 2021. The results are expected to be published by May 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This is among the first trials to incorporate health coaches, clinical pharmacists, and mHealth technologies to increase access to diabetes support among urban African‐Americans and Latinos to achieve therapeutic goals.

The aim of this study was to address a gap in the mHealth and health psychology literatures by investigating how individual differences in psychological traits are associated with mHealth effectiveness. Drawing from regulatory mode theory, we tested the role of locomotion and assessment in explaining why mHealth tools are effective for some but not everyone. A 13‐week pilot study investigated the effectiveness of an mHealth app in improving health behaviors among older veterans (n = 27) with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. We developed a gamified mHealth tool (DiaSocial) aimed at encouraging tracking of glucose control, exercise, nutrition, and medication adherence. Important individual differences in longitudinal trends of adherence, operationalized as points earned for healthy behavior, over the course of the 13‐week study period were found. Specifically, low locomotion was associated with unchanging levels of adherence during the course of the study. In contrast, high locomotion was associated with generally stronger adherence although it exhibited a quadratic longitudinal trend. In addition, high assessment was associated with a marginal, positive trend in adherence over time while low assessment was associated with a marginal, negative trend. Next, we examined the relationship between greater adherence and improved clinical outcomes, finding that greater adherence was associated with greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.

Diabetes medication non‐adherence is an important modifiable contributor to suboptimal glycemic management among Latino adults, who are nearly twice as likely to report non‐adherence to diabetes medications as non‐Hispanic White individuals. Besides language barriers, additional commonly reported barriers that contribute to non‐adherence in this population include negative perceptions about insulin use and misunderstanding ongoing need for diabetes medications once HbA1c has improved. Mobile health (mHealth) technology can reduce medication adherence barriers and improve adherence behavior, but mHealth tools that address commonly reported barriers to diabetes medication adherence among Latino adults are lacking.

This study assessed the utility and cost‐effectiveness of an automated Diabetes Remote Monitoring and Management System (DRMS) in glycemic control versus usual care. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled study, patients with uncontrolled diabetes on insulin were randomized to use of the DRMS or usual care. Participants in both groups were followed up for 6 months and had 3 clinic visits at 0, 3, and 6 months. The DRMS used text messages or phone calls to remind patients to test their blood glucose and to report results via an automated system, with no human interaction unless a patient had severely high or low blood glucose. The DRMS made adjustments to insulin dose(s) based on validated algorithms. Participants reported medication adherence through the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale‐8, and diabetes‐specific quality of life through the diabetes Daily Quality of Life questionnaire. A cost‐effectiveness analysis was conducted based on the estimated overall costs of DRMS and usual care. FINDINGS: A total of 98 patients were enrolled (59 [60%] female; mean age, 59 years); 87 participants (89%) completed follow‐up. HbA1c was similar between the DRMS and control groups at 3 months (7.60% vs 8.10%) and at 6 months (8.10% vs 7.90%). Changes from baseline to 6 months were not statistically significant for self‐reported medication adherence and diabetes‐specific quality of life, with the exception of the Daily Quality of Life‐Social/Vocational Concerns subscale score (P = 0.04). IMPLICATIONS: An automated system like the DRMS may improve glycemic control to the same degree as usual clinic care and may significantly improve the social/vocational aspects of quality of life. Cost‐effectiveness analysis found DRMS to be cost‐effective when compared to usual care and suggests DRMS has a good scale of economy for program scale up.

Well‐designed mobile apps that meet the needs of diabetes patients and provide ongoing self‐management education and support are required. It was hypothesized that apps designed with such features can improve a range of measures including clinical outcomes, knowledge of diabetes, medication adherence, perceived ability for self‐management, and quality‐of‐life. This may eventually facilitate a more robust and cost‐effective approach for improving skills and motivation for the management of diabetes. Methods: This project will be conducted in two phases. It will initially employ a mixed methods study design to investigate the self‐management needs and perceptions of diabetes patients on the use of mobile apps to support diabetes self‐management. Results of the mixed methods study will inform the content and design of an app which will be employed as an intervention tool in a 12‐month parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT will compare outcomes in relation to standard‐of‐care alone with standard‐of‐care plus a mobile phone diabetes app among 150 insulin‐requiring types 1 and 2 diabetes patients. The primary outcome measures are clinical parameters such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipids, urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio, blood pressure, frequency in events of emergency hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Secondary outcomes include knowledge of diabetes, medication intake and adherence, perception of self‐care, and quality‐of‐life. Discussion: Results from this study will provide empirical evidence on the usefulness of a mobile app developed based on self‐management needs analysis of diabetic patients. The long‐term goal is to harness knowledge gained from this study to provide evidenced‐based data, which promote the scale‐up or adoption of mobile applications that provide regular, ongoing education and self‐management support to people living with diabetes.

Continuing to smoke after a T2D diagnosis is also associated with accelerated progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications and an increased risk of death. Smoking cessation is recommended as a standard treatment for diabetes. However, both patients and providers are faced with other challenging lifestyle changes and disease management processes, which lead to greater difficulty in quitting. Contingency management, or a method of providing financial incentives contingent upon positive behaviors, has shown promise for improving adherence to medication among diabetics and for improving smoking cessation in other populations. This approach could offer an innovative and scalable means of increasing abstinence in this group, ultimately reducing their risk of cancer. This is a multicenter pilot randomized controlled trial that will recruit participants in Oklahoma and in Strathclyde, Scotland. This pilot study aims to test the feasibility of providing incentives to patients with T2D contingent on remote biochemical verification using a smartphone carbon monoxide (CO) monitor. The investigators will use an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) smartphone application and CO sensor to monitor urges to smoke, stressors, smoking behaviors, and to validate continuous abstinence throughout the intervention. Two different contingency management structures will be explored to investigate the length of time incentives need to be offered.

However, their effectiveness and usability for a low‐middle‐income, racially diverse population are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of remote telemonitoring with team‐based management on people with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: This was a pragmatic 52‐week cluster‐randomized controlled study among 11 primary care government practices in Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: People with type 2 diabetes aged 18 and above, who had hemoglobin A1c ≥ 7.5% but less than 11.0% within the past 3 months and resided in the state of Selangor. INTERVENTION: The intervention group received home gluco‐telemonitors and transmitted glucose data to a care team who could adjust therapy accordingly. The team also facilitated self‐management by supporting participants to improve medication adherence, and encourage healthier lifestyle and use of resources to reduce risk factors. Usual care group received routine healthcare service. MAIN MEASURE: The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c at 24 weeks and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included change in fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, lipid levels, health‐related quality of life, and diabetes self‐efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 240 participants were recruited in this study.

Cardiovascular risk was defined as the presence of at least two out of the three risk factors: type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension. METHODS: For treatment of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension, four predefined routinely used drugs were selected. Drug adherence was investigated in a controlled randomized doctor blinded study with crossover design. The mAMS was used to measure and improve objectively the adherence by means of closed‐loop interactions. RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients (30 female) was 69.4 ± 4.8 years. A total of 1654 electronic blisters were handed out. A statistically significant difference (P = 0.04) between the monitoring and the control phase was observed for the diabetes medication only. In a post‐study questionnaire twenty‐nine patients appreciated that their physician knew if and when they had taken their medications and 13 asked for more or automated communication with their physicians. Only one subject withdrew from the study because of technical complexity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that mHealth based adherence management is feasible and well accepted by patients with increased cardiovascular risk. It may help to increase adherence, even in patients with high baseline adherence and, subsequently, lead to improved control of indicators including blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations.

However, telemedicine studies have shown a positive trend in regards to glycemic control. The telemedicine interventions that facilitate adjustment of medication seems to improve glycemic control more effectively. Hence, it is recommended that future telemedicine studies for patients with diabetes include patient‐specific suggestions for changes in medicine. Hence, the aim of the trial is to explore the effect of telemonitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on insulin therapy. Methods: The trial is an open‐label randomized controlled trial with a trial period of 3 months conducted in two sites in Denmark. Patients with T2D on insulin therapy will be randomized (1:1) to a telemonitoring group (intervention) or a usual care group (control). The telemonitoring group will use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pen, an activity tracker, and smartphone applications throughout the trial. Hospital staff will monitor the telemonitoring group and contact the subjects by telephone repeatedly throughout the trial period. The usual care group will use a blinded CGM the first and last 20 days of the trial and will use a blinded insulin pen for the entire period. The primary endpoint will be changed from baseline in CGM time in range (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) 3 months after randomization. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total daily dose, time above range, and time below range 3 months after randomization. Exploratory endpoints include health‐related quality of life, diabetes‐related quality of life, etc. Discussion: The DiaMonT trial will test a telemonitoring setup including various devices. Such a setup may be criticized, because it is impossible to determine which element(s) add to the potential effect. However, it is not possible and counterproductive to test the elements individually, since it is the full telemedicine setup that is being evaluated. The DiaMonT trial is the first Danish trial to explore the effect of telemonitoring on patients on insulin therapy.

All subjects are Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients enrolled in the National T2DM Disease Management Programme (DMP) offered by the German National Health Insurance System. Of all people living in Germany 90% are insured there; more than 60% of all T2DM patients insured there are ‐ voluntarily ‐ enrolled in the T2DM‐DMP. As in any DMP, the rationale is that by regular visits to the attending physician, strict application of National Guidelines and by keeping the patient in a narrow corridor of optimal biomedical parameters (SBP, DBP, BMI, and specific lab parameters), the probability of complications, hospitalizations and other functional impairments is minimized. The rationale of the study is that more information on individual risk profile and its changes in the course of care will lead to more patient empowerment adding to more effective preventing the manifestation of these risks. The Intervention Group, in addition to receiving the T2DM care standard according to the National Guidelines issued by AWMF, within the framework of the National T2DM Disease Management Programme, will receive individualized reports showing their personal risk for the characteristic T2DM complications. Reports are sent to attending general practitioners (GP) for communicating and explaining them to patients. The CDRM system entails a combination of several telematic instruments used by the patient, GP and medical specialists. Key functionalities of the network supporting the care approach are the software integration of GP practices and an automated data recording via digital devices of blood glucose meters. Furthermore, the CDRM‐Tool, Accu‐Chek Mellibase a client server application of Roche Diagnostics GmbH is connected to the system. It generates reports ‐ one for the physician and one for the patient ‐ on the current health status, describing the 10 year risk to develop a characteristic complication (separately for myocardial infarction, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation) and the potential to reduce this risk. These reports shall be used during consultations to help doctors and patients to communicate about diabetes associated risks and individual potential. The GP report shall ease doctor's therapy decisions. The patient report shall inform the patient to improve compliance, strengthen empowerment. The CDRM system gains this information by correlating the basic patient data plus the data from recent medical findings with the most recent diabetes research evidence. GPs of this intervention group will only get advice concerning how to use the CDRM system properly, no further (extra) intervention measures are permitted. In particular, no therapy recommendations from the research team to GPs how to decide on individual therapy or medication.

In addition, this is regarded as the most effective method for prevention and treatment of diabetes. However, many diabetic patients are now reported to lack proper management in Korea with a low level of compliance with treatment instruction. In that sense, it is urgently necessary to develop a program in which diabetic patients are able to effectively manage their own blood glucose at home, and to grasp the real state of self‐blood glucose measurement. Accordingly, a system to manage diabetes using electronic equipment such as mobile phone or the Internet is currently being developed and studied, for the effective management of diabetes with the help of highly evolving information technology. These investigators have developed a diabetes management program that provides an optimal solution based on a mobile device and software, so that individual patients can undergo a regular blood glucose test and achieve improvement and constant management of living habits by being properly informed of how to manage diabetes. This clinical study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of the application through the comparison between usual medical care and additional care using the smartphone application, targeting patients with type 2 diabetes who lack blood glucose control. This study is targeted at the subjects who are being treated at this hospital's endocrinology, are using a smartphone, and voluntarily signed the informed consent form (ICF). The subjects who pass the subject eligibility evaluation provide information regarding assessment items and demographic information using the smartphone application and questionnaire. Based on the information given by subjects, the medical team offers a management system that supports and improves the existing treatment process of diabetes using the application developed on its own.

A smart phone and/or web based application The app uses the latest digital technology to deliver support and resources to people with type 2 diabetes. Over a series of sessions, a virtual 'coach' interacts with and provides feedback on blood glucose monitoring, healthy eating, physical activity, foot‐care and medication taking. The behaviour change strategies used within the application will complement strategies used within the other components of the program, providing a seamless experience for the participant. For example, the goal setting strategies within the application will be complemented by a section within the user guide providing an explanation of the benefits of setting goals. Finally the application will have built in reminders at the end of each chat to remind users to also use the user guide and participant website to get the most of the program. Participants will be encouraged to use the app weekly, after uploading their previous week’s BG readings. They will also receive a blood glucose (BG) uploading kit: a new Roche Diagnostics Bluetooth‐equipped BG meter with capability to upload self‐monitored BG readings to the program database via smartphone ""app"". We estimate that 25% of participants will either not own a smartphone and/or will prefer to continue to use their own meter. Those who choose this option will be able to manually update their BG via the app. Roche Diagnostics will provide BG meters and uploading devices (SmartPix) at no cost for this study, which participants may or may not use i.e. they can use their own existing monitor. 2.A User Guide The user guide complements the use of the app and contains information to help users to get the most out of My Diabetes Coach program. Included within the guide is an introductory module on how to use the program for the first time, a frequently asked questions section, an explanation of the usefulness of using goal setting and problem solving strategies, tracking sheets for participants to record your progress throughout the program, and sources of more information on managing diabetes. 3. A Private Participant Website The program website will be restricted to the users of the program and will contain specific content that will complement the smart device application and user guide. The planned components of the website include: ‐Electronic version of the GP information sheet that participants can download and show to their health care professionals ‐Electronic versions of all sections of the user guide ‐Electronic versions of Diabetes Australia Factsheets (blood glucose monitoring, hypoglycaemia and diabetes, physical activity and type 2 diabetes, food choices for people with diabetes, medications for type 2 diabetes, sick days and type 2 diabetes, diabetes and your feet, smoking, prediabetes and diabetes, depression and diabetes) and links to state specific information Diabetes Queensland, Diabetes WA and Diabetes Victoria. ‐An online community that participants can read and comment upon ‐Links to helpful information about eye health and diabetes (Vision Australia and Macular Disease Foundation Australia) 4.A Public Project Website 5.A Program Coordinator CONDITION: Type 2 Diabetes ; ‐Links to general health information (National Heart Foundation, Healthinsite, Health Direct Information Line, Queensland Health, Department of Health Victoria, WA Health, Kidney Health Australia). This project website will have general information about the project and the people involved with its execution, as well as an expression of interest form and general information for GP’s and health professionals. The Coordinator trains participants in how to use the app, resolves any technical issues relating to use of the app, and responds to and relays clinical alerts produced by the system to GP’s when necessary. After receiving the participants registration, and consent form, and prior to receiving access to the app, the research team will send a letter to their GP which will explain how the GP can help participants to tailor the program to the person with diabetes’ (PWD) needs i.e. asking them to provide individualised self‐care clinical targets (e.g. targets for BG, and frequency of testing, and physical activity goals). The latter will be entered into the program database to tailor conversations with each person. These steps have been implemented successfully with more than 95% of previous trial participants. Participants will be contacted at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks to elicit and address any difficulties. Additionally, alerts will be generated by the system, prompting the Research Team to call the participant if s/he does not call the program for two consecutive weeks and/or after any clinical alerts (e.g. high/low BG levels) or technical alerts (e.g. BG uploading failed). A summary of the participant’s ; Specifically, it will be measured by the following questions: How do we ensure: Implementation in various contexts and groups? Adherence to program delivery? There are no barriers and enablers to delivery? The cost of delivery and staffing requirements are kept low? The answers will be provided by logs of study invitation letters sent and queries received by DA staff, Diabetes Australia staff, coordinator and users’ interviews, GP questionnaires and interviews, program/system logs, coordinator notes, user acceptability questionnaires, and implementation cost questionnaires.

Results: Although the control group showed no difference on any measures at 3 weeks, the intervention group reported significant mean percentage improvements on all measures: medication adherence (57%, standard deviation [SD] 18%–96%, SD 9), diet (50%, SD 33%–75%, SD 28), and exercise (29%, SD 31%–43%, SD 33). At 3 months, the mean HbA1c levels in the intervention group were significantly lower (9.6) than baseline (10.7). Conclusion: Many programs to improve adherence have been proved to be expensive and marginally effective. Therefore, improvements from the single use of a 12‐min‐long “app” are noteworthy. This is the first ever randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate that an “app” can impact the gold standard biological marker, HbA1c, in diabetes.",11,,271‐275,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 614514431,,,,Journal article,*diabetes mellitus; *mobile application; *patient compliance; *treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Article; Controlled study; Diabetic patient; Diet; Exercise; Female; Human; Major clinical study; Male; Patient referral; Self report,10.2147/PPA.S122490,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01336862/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Since any mistake in insulin use can lead to hyperglycemic crisis or severe hypoglycemia, correct administration of insulin forms the basis of successful diabetes management. Errors related to insulin therapy are defined as important and correctable medication errors. Such errors related to insulin therapy can potentially occur at every step of diabetes management. It is stated that interventions that can provide effective self‐management and behavioral change can be planned by evaluating individuals' perceptions of the disease and treatment in diabetes management. In our country, only one thesis study evaluating the effect of video‐supported teaching given to type 2 diabetic patients on insulin self‐management and application skills has been found. This study found that video‐assisted instruction given to patients with Type 2 diabetes increased their ability to administer insulin injections and their self‐management. In the thesis study in question, the video was shot by the researcher using a model, and individuals who had been using insulin for at least one year were included in the study. In this project, a mobile application for insulin use will be developed and this application will include three separate videos, two of which are animation videos, and a game for insulin use. Our study will be conducted on individuals who will use insulin for the first time, and no study has been found in our country with this sample and population. When global goals for sustainable development are examined, it is aimed to ""promote mental health and well‐being by reducing premature deaths from non‐communicable diseases by one third through prevention and treatment by 2030"". The development of technology and its availability in every aspect of life has also affected patient care, and technological devices and mobile applications have been integrated into patient care. Studies show that the mobile applications used are effective in managing the disease and maintaining self‐care activities in individuals with Type 2 DM. In chronic disease management, both compliance with treatment and self‐management can be made permanent with mobile applications developed specifically for the disease. In the research, the educational material was created with an animated video, and the created video was transferred to the mobile application. Thus, the patient will be able to access the educational content via the mobile application at any time and experience the insulin administration steps countless times on the mobile application. By giving feedback from the application regarding the mistakes made during the application, the user will be able to see at what point he made a mistake. Audiovisual materials used in patient education positively affect learning because they appeal to more than one sensory organ. Utilizing technology and using visual and auditory stimuli in patient education will strengthen learning, and the skills aimed to be acquired with the educational material will become more permanent.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06060743,,,Trial registry record,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Insulin",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02602182/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Many of these costs are related to poor medication adherence and lack of self‐care behaviors and are thus preventable. Depression, which is more prevalent among people with diabetes than in the general population, predicts poorer management of ones diabetes, whereas positive affect predicts engaging in more positive health behaviors. Consequently, interventions that improve depression and positive affect may also improve diabetes‐related outcomes among people with diabetes. Although preliminary research on the impact of such interventions among people with diabetes is promising, these studies focused primarily on in‐person interventions, have had small samples, and lack long‐term follow‐up. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the short‐ and long‐term effects of a digital therapeutic platform focused on mental health among adults with poorly managed type 2 diabetes and elevated levels of depression. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial in which adults with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (?7), and moderate to severe depressive symptoms will be randomly assigned to a positive emotion regulation skills intervention group or a sham digital intervention with only psychoeducational content. The study will take place over 14 months, including the 8‐week intervention (or control) delivered via a digital therapeutic platform (Happify Health) and follow‐up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. Throughout the intervention and for 1 week at each postintervention follow‐up, participants will complete daily assessments of diabetes‐related distress, diabetes regimen adherence, and mood. Our primary outcome, HbA1c, will be self‐reported every 3 months throughout the study. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will be assessed at baseline; at 8 weeks; and at 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. RESULTS: Recruitment is expected to begin in June 2020. Participants will begin the study as they are recruited and will finish in waves. The final wave of data collection from the 8‐week intervention is expected for winter 2020, with the completion of the 12‐month follow‐up in winter 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous research suggests that in‐person psychological interventions have promising effects on both psychological and physical outcomes among adults with diabetes, digital interventions can be advantageous because they are easily scalable and reduce many barriers that prevent people from seeking treatment. This trial will provide important information about the effects of a digital mental health intervention among adults with type 2 diabetes, assessing both short‐ and long‐term effects of this intervention on HbA1c, depressive symptoms, and other diabetes‐specific outcomes. If successful, this may introduce a scalable intervention that would help reduce some of the preventable costs associated with diabetes.

Risk of serious complications can be reduced through use of effective treatments and active self‐management. However, people are often concerned about starting new medicines and face difficulties in taking them regularly. Use of brief messages to provide education and support self‐management, delivered through mobile phone‐based text messages, can be an effective tool for some long‐term conditions. We have developed messages aiming to support patients' self‐management of type 2 diabetes in the use of medications and other aspects of self‐management, underpinned by theory and evidence. The aim of this trial is to determine the feasibility of a large‐scale clinical trial to test the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the intervention, compared with usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The feasibility trial will be a multicentre individually randomised, controlled trial in primary care recruiting adults (≥35 years) with type 2 diabetes in England. Consenting participants will be randomised to receive short text messages three times a week with messages designed to produce change in medication adherence or non‐health‐related messages for 6 months. The aims are to test recruitment methods, retention to the study, the feasibility of data collection and the mobile phone and web‐based processes of a proposed definitive trial and to refine the text messaging intervention. The primary outcome is the rate of recruitment to randomisation of participants to the trial. Data, including patient reported measures, will be collected online at baseline and the end of the 6‐month follow‐up period. With 200 participants (100 in each group), this trial is powered to estimate 80% follow‐up within 95% CIs of 73.8% to 85.3%. The analysis will follow a prespecified plan. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 05. The results will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer‐reviewed journals and will be published on the trial website: www.summit‐d.org (SuMMiT‐D (SUpport through Mobile Messaging and digital health Technology for Diabetes)).

OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of two different magnitudes of financial incentives for improving adherence to remote‐monitoring regimens among patients with poorly controlled diabetes. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01282957). PARTICIPANTS: Seventy‐five patients with a hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 7.5% recruited from a Primary Care Medical Home practice at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve weeks of daily home‐monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight (control group; n = 28); a lottery incentive with expected daily value of $2.80 (n = 26) for daily monitoring; and a lottery incentive with expected daily value of $1.40 (n = 21) for daily monitoring. MAIN MEASURES: Daily use of three home‐monitoring devices during the three‐month intervention (primary outcome) and during the three‐month follow‐up period and change in A1c over the intervention period (secondary outcomes). KEY RESULTS: Incentive arm participants used devices on a higher proportion of days relative to control (81% low incentive vs. 58%, P = 0.007; 77% high incentive vs. 58%, P = 0.02) during the three‐month intervention period. There was no difference in adherence between the two incentive arms (P = 0.58). When incentives were removed, adherence in the high incentive arm declined while remaining relatively high in the low incentive arm. In month 6, the low incentive arm had an adherence rate of 62% compared to 35% in the high incentive arm (P = 0.015) and 27% in the control group (P = 0.002).

One of the support strategies involves participating in a Dynamic Diffusion Network and the other support strategy consists of technical assistance. The Dynamic Diffusion Network was developed as a method for implementing and adapting comple Xclinical interventions. It is designed to enhance the evidence‐based implementation of clinical EBPs that utilize existing structures within facilities. The DDN recognizes the need to: 1) have engaged facilities; 2) plan to link quality goals and EBP components to the workflow; 3) facilitate rapid cycle quality improvement and 4) plan for sustainment and further spread. The DDN QUERI Program will evaluate the DDN with selected VA facilities in comparison to providing information about diabetes self‐management and responding to facility questions about the process of delivering self‐management modules, along with telemonitoring patient glucose levels and specialist‐guided medication management (i.e., technical assistance).

Meanwhile, the American Geriatrics Society has created the Choosing Wisely (CW) initiative to promote less aggressive glycemic targets and reduction in pharmacologic therapy in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To date, few studies have shown the effectiveness of combined BE and EHR approaches for managing chronic conditions, and none have addressed guideline‐driven deprescribing specifically in type 2 diabetes. We previously conducted a pilot study aimed at promoting appropriate CW guideline adherence using BE nudges and EHRs embedded within CDS tools at 5 clinics within the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) system. The BE‐EHR module intervention was tested for usability, adoption, and early effectiveness. Preliminary results suggested a modest improvement of 5.1% in CW compliance. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that will investigate the effectiveness of a BE‐EHR module intervention that leverages BE nudges with EHR technology and CDS tools to reduce overtreatment of type 2 diabetes in adults aged 76 years and older, per the CW guideline. METHODS: A pragmatic, investigator‐blind, cluster randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the BE‐EHR module. A total of 66 NYULH clinics will be randomized 1:1 to receive for 18 months either (1) a 6‐component BE‐EHR module intervention + standard care within the NYULH EHR, or (2) standard care only. The intervention will be administered to clinicians during any patient encounter (eg, in person, telemedicine, medication refill, etc). The primary outcome will be patient‐level CW compliance. Secondary outcomes will measure the frequency of intervention component firings within the NYULH EHR, and provider utilization and interaction with the BE‐EHR module components. RESULTS: Study recruitment commenced on December 7, 2020, with the activation of all 6 BE‐EHR components in the NYULH EHR.

CONCLUSIONS: This study will test the effectiveness of a previously developed, iteratively refined, user‐tested, and pilot‐tested BE‐EHR module aimed at providing appropriate diabetes care to elderly adults, compared to usual care via a cluster randomized controlled trial. This innovative research will be the first pragmatic randomized controlled trial to use BE principles embedded within the EHR and delivered using CDS tools to specifically promote CW guideline adherence in type 2 diabetes. The study will also collect valuable information on clinician workflow and interaction with the BE‐EHR module, guiding future research in optimizing the timely delivery of BE nudges within CDS tools.

Thermometry, measuring the temperature of the feet, is a promising emerging modality for diabetic foot ulcer prevention. However, patient compliance with at‐home monitoring is concerning. Delivering messages to remind patients to perform thermometry and foot care might be helpful to guarantee regular foot monitoring. This trial was designed to compare the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) between participants who receive thermometry alone and those who receive thermometry as well as mHealth (SMS and voice messaging) over a year‐long study period. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an evaluator‐blinded, randomized, 12‐month trial. Individuals with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged between 18‐80 years, having a present dorsalis pedis pulse in both feet, are in risk group 2 or 3 using the diabetic foot risk classification system (as specified by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot), have an operating cell phone or a caregiver with an operating cell phone, and have the ability to provide informed consent will be eligible to participate in the study. Recruitment will be performed in diabetes outpatient clinics at two Ministry of Health tertiary hospitals in Lima, Peru. INTERVENTIONS: participants in both groups will receive education about foot care at the beginning of the study and they will be provided with a thermometry device (TempStat™). TempStat™ is a tool that captures a thermal image of the feet, which, depending on the temperature of the feet, shows different colors. In this study, if a participant notes a single yellow image or variance between one foot and the contralateral foot, they will be prompted to notify a nurse to evaluate their activity within the previous 2 weeks and make appropriate recommendations. In addition to thermometry, participants in the intervention arm will receive an mHealth component in the form of SMS and voice messages as reminders to use the thermometry device, and instructions to promote foot care. OUTCOMES: the primary outcome is foot ulceration, evaluated by a trained nurse, occurring at any point during the study. DISCUSSION: This study has two principal contributions towards the prevention of DFU. First, the introduction of messages to promote self‐management of diabetes foot care as well as using reminders as a strategy to improve adherence to daily home‐based measurements. Secondly, the implementation of a thermometry‐based strategy complemented by SMS and voice messages in an LMIC setting, with wider implications for scalability.

This study examined the change in adherence over time and in response to a telemedicine intervention for elderly diabetes patients in these groups compared to white diabetes patients. We also examined whether adherence mediated the effect of the intervention on glycemic control (A1c). DESIGN: The Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine project randomized medically underserved Medicare patients (n=1665) to telemedicine case management (televideo educator visits, individualized goal‐setting/problem solving) or usual care. Hispanic and African‐American educators delivered the intervention in Spanish if needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual assessment included A1c and self‐reported adherence (Summary of Diabetes Self‐Care Activities scale). A simple model (only time and group terms) and a model with covariates (e.g., age) were examined for baseline and 5 years of follow‐up. SAS PROC Mixed was used with non‐linear terms to examine mediating effects of adherence on A1c, by performing tests of the mediating path coefficients. RESULTS: Over time, self‐reported adherence improved for the treatment group compared to usual care (p<0.001). There was no significant interaction with racial/ethnic group membership, i.e., all groups improved. However, minority subjects were consistently less adherent than whites. Also, greater comorbidity and diabetes symptoms predicted poorer adherence, greater duration of diabetes and more years of education predicted better adherence. Adherence was a significant mediator of A1c (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A unique, tailored telemedicine intervention was effective in achieving improved adherence to diabetes self care. However, African‐American and Hispanic American participants were less adherent than white participants at all time points despite an individualized and accessible intervention.

We conducted a randomized controlled study to confirm the effectiveness of remote management using the mobile phone WeChat app on comprehensive management of diabetes mellitus during the COVID‐19 epidemic. Methods: We distributed questionnaires that collected information on the health condition of people with diabetes during the COVID‐19 epidemic through the WeChat app. We assigned 90 cases to the intervention group and 90 cases to the control group. The intervention group was managed remotely through the WeChat app, and the control group received traditional medical treatment. The blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), time in range (TIR) and incidence of hypoglycemia were compared after three months of follow‐up. Results: The BMI and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) of the control group at 3 months was significantly higher than that at baseline (P < 0.001), and TIR decreased at 3 months (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in blood pressure compared with baseline in the control group, while blood pressure decreased in the intervention group (P < 0.05). In the intervention group, fast blood glucose(FBG) and PBG decreased compared with their baseline values, and the TIR level increased, both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The FBG, PBG, and TIR of the intervention group were better than those in the control group at 3 months (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia between the two groups.

Glycaemic control decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the pregnant individual and infant. Achieving glycaemic control can be challenging for Medicaid‐insured pregnant individuals who experience a high burden of unmet social needs. Multifaceted provider‐patient‐based approaches are needed to improve glycaemic control in this high‐risk pregnant population. Mobile health (mHealth) applications (app), provider dashboards, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and addressing social needs have been independently associated with improved glycaemic control in non‐pregnant individuals living with diabetes. The combined effect of these interventions on glycaemic control among pregnant individuals with T2D remains to be evaluated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a two‐arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the combined effects of a multicomponent provider‐patient intervention, including a patient mHealth app, provider dashboard, CGM, a community health worker to address non‐medical health‐related social needs and team‐based care versus the current standard of diabetes and prenatal care. We will recruit 124 Medicaid‐insured pregnant individuals living with T2D, who are ≤20 weeks of gestation with poor glycaemic control measured as a haemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5% assessed within 12 weeks of trial randomisation or within 12 weeks of enrolling in prenatal care from an integrated diabetes and prenatal care programme at a tertiary care academic health system located in the Midwestern USA. We will measure how many individuals achieve the primary outcome of glycaemic control measured as an A1c<6.5% by the time of delivery, and secondarily, adverse pregnancy outcomes; patient‐reported outcomes (eg, health and technology engagement, literacy and comprehension; provider‐patient communication; diabetes self‐efficacy; distress, knowledge and beliefs; social needs referrals and utilisation; medication adherence) and CGM measures of glycaemic control (in the intervention group).

For primary analysis, adjusted mean HbA1c was 5.60 mmol/mol / 0.51% lower (95% CI 2.38 to 8.81 mmol/mol/ 95% CI 0.22% to 0.81%, p = 0·0007). For secondary analyses, adjusted mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 3.06 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.56–5.56 mmHg, p = 0.017) and mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure was 2.17 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.62–3.72, p = 0.006) among people in the intervention group when compared with usual care after adjustment for baseline differences and minimization strata. No significant differences were identified between groups in weight, treatment pattern, adherence to medication, or quality of life in secondary analyses. There were few adverse events and these were equally distributed between the intervention and control groups. In secondary analysis, there was a greater number of telephone calls between practice nurses and patients in the intervention compared with control group (rate ratio 7.50 (95% CI 4.45–12.65, p < 0.0001) but no other significant differences between groups in use of health services were identified between groups. Key limitations include potential lack of representativeness of trial participants, inability to blind participants and health professionals, and uncertainty about the mechanism, the duration of the effect, and the optimal length of the intervention. Conclusions: Supported telemonitoring resulted in clinically important improvements in control of glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes in family practice.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that CGM can reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and increase in the time in range metric. Little is known about CGM use in the broader population with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in low‐income, minority populations not receiving insulin therapy. This proposed study will rigorously evaluate CGM in a diverse and vulnerable population with T2DM in the primary care setting. The proposed study will integrate CGM into the study team's previously studied approach of mobile health (mHealth) diabetes management. The investigators prior research has leveraged mHealth tools and a community health worker (CHW)/clinical pharmacist team to manage low‐income, minority populations with T2DM. Clinical pharmacists embedded in the healthcare system review patient glucose levels, promote medication adherence and collaboratively adjust therapy to help patients reach HbA1c goals. CHWs augment pharmacist‐led efforts and address social determinants of health and provide individualized, contextual self‐management support. In partnership with Baystate Community Health Centers and UMass Memorial Health, the investigators propose an effectiveness study of team‐supported CGM using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) study design. The investigators plan to study a diverse population with 318 T2DM patients receiving pharmacist‐ and CHW‐supported CGM delivered through community health centers in Massachusetts. The Specific Aims include: (1) Conduct a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist‐supported CGM in a diverse patient population with T2DM in the primary care setting. The investigators hypothesize that pharmacist‐supported CGM will result in improved HbA1c, CGM metrics, and other secondary outcomes (e.g., quality of life) at 6 months compared with pharmacist‐only care; (2) Re‐randomize patients not at HbA1c goal after 6 months to receive or not receive CHW support beyond pharmacist‐supported CGM. The investigators hypothesize that adding CHWs will result in improved HbA1c, CGM metrics, and other secondary outcomes at 12 months compared with pharmacist‐supported CGM alone; (3) Evaluate reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using the RE‐AIM framework; and (4) Determine total cost and cost‐effectiveness of CGM and the supportive components (e.g., clinical pharmacist and CHW) from the perspective of the healthcare organization.

Telemonitoring is postulated to bridge this gap by leveraging on internet‐of‐things and mobile‐health technology. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a novel telemonitoring system (OPTIMUM) in improving the glycaemic control of patients with T2DM compared with standard of care alone. Methods: This mixed‐method study comprises an initial randomised controlled trial involving 330 Asian adults with T2DM, aged 26?65 years old with an HbA1c of 7.5?10%, with 115 in the intervention and control arms each. Those in the intervention arm will use standardised Bluetooth‐enabled devices to transmit their capillary glucose, blood pressure and weight measurements to the OPTIMUM system. Primary care physicians and nurses will remotely supervise them according to an embedded management algorithm for 6 months, including tele‐education via weekly videos over 8�weeks and asynchronous tele‐consultation if abnormal or absent parameters are detected. Patients in both arms will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months post‐recruitment. The primary outcome will be their HbA1c difference between both arms at baseline and 6 months. Blood pressure and weight control; quality of life, medication adherence, confidence in self‐management, diabetic literacy and related distress and healthcare utilisation using validated questionnaires; and incident retinal, renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular complications will be compared between the two arms as secondary outcomes at stipulated time‐points. Intervention arm patients will be interviewed using qualitative research methods to understand their experience, acceptance and perceived usefulness of the OPTIMUM system. Discussion: Overall, this study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of cultural‐adapted telemonitoring system in improving glycaemic control of Asians with type‐2 diabetes mellitus compared to standard of care. The results of this trial will better inform policy makers in adopting telemedicine for population health management. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04306770.

Cardiovascular quality and outcomes,2019,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions may support risk factor management and are readily scalable in healthcare systems. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of a text messaging‐based intervention to improve glycemic control in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus in China. METHODS AND RESULTS: The CHAT‐DM study (Cardiovascular Health and Texting‐Diabetes Mellitus) was a parallel‐group, single‐blind, randomized clinical trial that included 502 patients with both coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus from 34 hospitals in China. The intervention group (n=251) received 6 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Messages were theory driven and culturally tailored to provide educational and motivational information on glucose monitoring, blood pressure control, medication adherence, physical activity, and lifestyle. The control group (n=251) received usual care and 2 thank you messages per month. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C [hemoglobin A1C]) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes were change in proportion of patients achieving HbA1C <7%, fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, LDL (low‐density lipoprotein) cholesterol, body mass index, and physical activity from baseline to 6 months. The end points were assessed using analyses of covariance. The follow‐up rate was 99%. When compared with control group at 6 months, the intervention group had a greater reduction in HbA1C (‐0.2% versus 0.1%; P=0.003) and a greater proportion of participants who achieved HbA1C <7% (69.3% versus 52.6%; P=0.004). Change in fasting blood glucose was larger in the intervention group (between‐group difference: ‐0.6 mmol/L; 95% CI, ‐1.1 to ‐0.2; P=0.011), but no other outcome differences were observed. Nearly all participants reported that messages were easy to understand (97.1%) and useful (94.1%). CONCLUSIONS: A text message intervention resulted in better glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. While the mechanism of this benefit remains to be determined, the results suggest that a simple, culturally sensitive mobile text messaging program may provide an effective and feasible way to improve disease self‐management.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the impact of an mHealth app that incorporated theory‐driven trigger messages. These messages took different forms following the Fogg behavior model (FBM) and targeted self‐efficacy, knowledge, and self‐care. We assess the feasibility of our app in modifying these behaviors in a pilot study involving individuals with diabetes. METHODS: The pilot randomized unblinded study comprised two cohorts recruited as employees from within a health care system. In total, 20 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited for the study and a within‐subjects design was utilized. Each participant interacted with an app called capABILITY. capABILITY and its affiliated trigger (text) messages integrate components from social cognitive theory (SCT), FBM, and persuasive technology into the interactive health communications framework. In this within‐subjects design, participants interacted with the capABILITY app and received (or did not receive) text messages in alternative blocks. The capABILITY app alone was the control condition along with trigger messages including spark and facilitator messages. A repeated‐measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare adherence with behavioral measures and engagement with the mobile app across conditions. A paired sample t test was utilized on each health outcome to determine changes related to capABILITY intervention, as well as participants' classified usage of capABILITY. RESULTS: Pre‐ and postintervention results indicated statistical significance on 3 of the 7 health survey measures (general diet: P=.03; exercise: P=.005; and blood glucose: P=.02). When only analyzing the high and midusers (n=14) of capABILITY, we found a statistically significant difference in both self‐efficacy (P=.008) and exercise (P=.01). Although the ANOVA did not reveal any statistically significant differences across groups, there is a trend among spark conditions to respond more quickly (ie, shorter log‐in lag) following the receipt of the message. CONCLUSIONS: Our theory‐driven mHealth app appears to be a feasible means of improving self‐efficacy and health‐related behaviors. Although our sample size is too small to draw conclusions about the differential impact of specific forms of trigger messages, our findings suggest that spark triggers may have the ability to cue engagement in mobile tools. This was demonstrated with the increased use of capABILITY at the beginning and conclusion of the study depending on spark timing. Our results suggest that theory‐driven personalization of mobile tools is a viable form of intervention.

The role of technology has been gaining strong support as evidence builds of its potential to improve diabetes management; however, evaluation of its impact in minority populations is limited. This study intends to provide early evidence of a theory‐driven intervention, Tablet‐Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self‐management skills (TABLETS), using real‐time videoconferencing for education and skills training. We examine the potential for TABLETS to improve health risk behaviors and reduce CVD risk outcomes among a low‐income African American (AA) population with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study is a two‐arm, pilot controlled trial that randomizes 30 participants to the TABLETS intervention and 30 participants to a usual care group. Blinded outcome assessments will be completed at baseline, 2.5 months (immediate post‐intervention), and 6.5 months (follow‐up). The TABLETS intervention consists of culturally tailored telephone‐delivered diabetes education and skills training delivered via videoconferencing on tablet devices, with two booster sessions delivered via tablet‐based videoconferencing at 3 months and 5 months to stimulate ongoing use of the tablet device with access to intervention materials via videoconferencing slides and a manual of supplementary materials. The primary outcomes are physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self‐monitoring behavior, whereas the secondary outcomes are HbA1c, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), BP, CVD risk, and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a theory‐driven, tablet‐aided behavioral intervention that utilizes real‐time videoconferencing technology for education and skills training on self‐management behaviors and quality of life among a high‐risk, low‐income AA population with an uncontrolled dyad or triad of CVD risk factors (diabetes with or without hypertension or hyperlipidemia). The intervention leverages the use of novel technology for education and skill‐building to foster improved diabetes self‐management. The findings of this study will inform the process of disseminating the intervention to a broader and larger sample of people and can potentially be refined to align with clinical workflows that target a subsample of patients with poor diabetes self‐management.

As individuals have their mobile phones in close vicinity during most parts of the day, nudge interventions can be pushed to the users through the phone at critical times – e.g.,: closer to snacking time periods in the evening, when users most want, or likely need, the support. Over 2 week period, individuals will be daily (micro‐) randomized to receive a nudge SMS or no message. Each participant acts as their own control. MRT involves randomly assigning an intervention option at each relevant decision point: a point in time when—based on theory, participant’s past behaviour, and the participant’s current context—a particular intervention component might be efficacious. MRT will occur daily for two‐weeks to either a tailored nudge or no nudge. These nudges will delivered at a time that is nominated at screening as being the optimal time to receive it. A brief snippet of the nudge will be delivered thorough MMS (for Android phones) and iMessage (for iPhone users) on nudge days. When clicked, the full message will be shown in the study App (Intui Research). Automatic read receipt and user feedback response is recorded when the app is opened and the full version of the nudge content is accessed. Nudge content includes information about the negative consequences of snacking after dinner and/or immediately actionable alternatives. Nudges will be delivered in the evening, at a time the participant indicates the behaviour typically occurs, and at a time that will suit them to receive the message.

Most outcomes were improved when community health workers used either an interactive e‐Health tool or print materials. This article investigates mediators and moderators of improved medication adherence in these two models. METHOD: Because both programs significantly improved satisfaction with medication information, medication knowledge, and decisional conflict, we examined whether improvements in each of these outcomes in turn were associated with improvements in self‐reported medication adherence, and if so, whether these improvements were mediated by improvements in diabetes self‐efficacy or diabetes distress. Potential moderators of improvement included gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, insulin use, health literacy, and baseline self‐efficacy, diabetes distress, and A1c. RESULTS: A total of 176 participants (94%) completed all assessments. After adjusting for potential confounders, only increased satisfaction with medication information was correlated with improved medication adherence ( p = .024). Improved self‐efficacy, but not diabetes distress, was associated with improvements in both satisfaction with medication information and medication adherence. However, the Sobel‐Goodman Mediation test did not support improvements in self‐efficacy as a mechanism by which improved satisfaction led to better adherence. None of the examined variables achieved statistical significance as moderators. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in satisfaction with medication information but not in medication knowledge or decision conflict were associated with improvements in medication adherence. Interventions that target low‐income ethnic and racial minorities may need to focus on increasing participants' satisfaction with information provided on diabetes medications and not just improving their knowledge about medications. Future research should explore in more depth other possible mediators and moderators of improvements in medication adherence in low‐income minority populations.",44,2,285‐296,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 27417502,,,,,Journal article,"Black or African American [statistics & numerical data]; Community Health Workers; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy, ethnology]; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hispanic or Latino [statistics & numerical data]; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Poverty; Self Efficacy; Telemedicine",10.1177/1090198116656331,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01600900/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

This was to inform the design and conduct of a future large‐scale United Kingdom‐based clinical trial and establish the feasibility of recruitment, the technology used, follow‐up, and data collection. Methods: A multicentre individually randomised, controlled parallel group trial in primary care, recruiting adults (≥ 35 years) with type 2 diabetes in England. Consenting participants were randomly allocated to receive short message system text messages up to four times a week, or usual care, for a period of 6 months; messages contained behavioural change techniques targeting medication use. The primary outcome was the rate of recruitment to randomisation of participants to the trial with a planned rate of 22 participants randomised per month. The study also aimed to establish the feasibility of follow‐up at 6 months, with an aim of retaining more than 80% of participants. Data, including patient‐reported measures, were collected at baseline and the end of the 6‐month follow‐up period, and a notes review was completed at 24 months. Results: The trial took place between 26 November 2018 and 30 September 2019. In total 209 participants were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 103) or usual care (n = 106). The maximum rate of monthly recruitment to the trial was 60–80 participants per month. In total, 12,734 messages were sent to participants. Of these messages, 47 were identified as having failed to be sent by the service provider. Participants sent 2,864 messages to the automated messaging system. Baseline data from medical records were available for > 90% of participants with the exception of cholesterol (78.9%). At 6 months, a further HbA1c measurement was reported for 67% of participants. In total medical record data were available at 6 months for 207 (99.0%) of participants and completed self‐report data were available for 177 (84.7%) of participants. Conclusion: The feasibility of a large‐scale randomised evaluation of brief message intervention for people with type 2 diabetes appears to be high using this efficient design. Failure rate of sending messages is low, rapid recruitment was achieved among people with type 2 diabetes, clinical data is available on participants from routine medical records and self‐report of economic measures was acceptable.

We investigated whether health professional review of telemetrically transmitted self‐monitored glucose results in improved glycemic control in people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Supported telemonitoring resulted in clinically important improvements in control of glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes in family practice. Current Controlled Trials, registration number ISRCTN71674628. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 71674628. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a randomized, parallel, investigator‐blind controlled trial with centralized randomization in family practices in four regions of the United Kingdom among 321 people with type 2 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >58 mmol/mol. The supported telemonitoring intervention involved self‐measurement and transmission to a secure website of twice‐weekly morning and evening glucose for review by family practice clinicians who were not blinded to allocation group. The control group received usual care, with at least annual review and more frequent reviews for people with poor glycemic or blood pressure control. HbA1c assessed at 9 mo was the primary outcome. Intention‐to‐treat analyses were performed. 160 people were randomized to the intervention group and 161 to the usual care group between June 6, 2011, and July 19, 2013. HbA1c data at follow‐up were available for 146 people in the intervention group and 139 people in the control group. The mean (SD) HbA1c at follow‐up was 63.0 (15.5) mmol/mol in the intervention group and 67.8 (14.7) mmol/mol in the usual care group. For primary analysis, adjusted mean HbA1c was 5.60 mmol/mol / 0.51% lower (95% CI 2.38 to 8.81 mmol/mol/ 95% CI 0.22% to 0.81%, p = 0·0007). For secondary analyses, adjusted mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 3.06 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.56‐5.56 mmHg, p = 0.017) and mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure was 2.17 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.62‐3.72, p = 0.006) among people in the intervention group when compared with usual care after adjustment for baseline differences and minimization strata. No significant differences were identified between groups in weight, treatment pattern, adherence to medication, or quality of life in secondary analyses. There were few adverse events and these were equally distributed between the intervention and control groups. In secondary analysis, there was a greater number of telephone calls between practice nurses and patients in the intervention compared with control group (rate ratio 7.50 (95% CI 4.45‐12.65, p < 0.0001) but no other significant differences between groups in use of health services were identified between groups.

322,322,CN-02291275,"NCT04993326,","Advancing DSME/S and COVID-19 Prevention and Protection Through ""emPOWERed to Change"" Program",https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04993326,2021,"Several studies have shown that COVID‐19 patients with co‐existing diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non‐invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. Another important finding is that African Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) are disproportionately impacted by COVID‐19 to an extent not observed in other racial/ethnic subgroups. Diabetes Self‐Management Education and Support (DSMS/S) facilitates the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary for diabetes self‐care as well as activities that assist a person in implementing and sustaining the behaviors needed to manage their condition on an ongoing basis. Now, given the implications of COVID‐19 on the AA/POC diabetes community, it is imperative to enhance DSME/S with education about protection and prevention of COVID‐19. We will adapt and implement the ""emPOWERed to Change"" DSME/S program to provide enhanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) education with an additional emphasis on COVID‐19 protection and prevention. The proposed hypothesis, based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), is: African Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) in Los Angeles County with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) randomized to participate in the ""emPOWERed to Change"" program (N=48) are more likely to demonstrate sustained glycemic control, increase in knowledge and skills related behaviors, and risk factors associated with T2DM and SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) and increased compliance with prevention, and vaccination as compared to those who are randomized to usual care (N=48) in this 12 week program. Aim 1: to determine the efficacy of the ""emPOWERed to Change"" program on the knowledge and skills related to eating habits, physical activity, stress management, and medication adherence in the AA/POC population with type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: we hypothesized that AA/POC participants randomized to the program will have 20% increased knowledge and skills related to eating habits, physical activity, stress management, medication adherence, and control of diabetes compared to those randomized to the usual care. Aim 2 to determine the effect of the ""emPOWERed to Change"" program on the knowledge related to T2DM and COVID‐19 (risk factors, prevention of infection, COVID‐19 vaccines, and access resources for vaccination) and compliance with prevention and vaccination against COVID‐19. Hypothesis: we hypothesized that AA/POC participants randomized to the program will have 20% increase in knowledge related to T2DM and COVID‐19, compliance with prevention and vaccination against COVID‐19 compared to those randomized to the usual care. We propose a randomized control study design among 96 participants with 48 assigned to an intervention group and 48 assigned to a control group. This study will also explore the experience of the participants' appraisal of knowledge and skills acquisition for DSME/S to maintain T2DM control, reduce complications, and SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) prevention and protection. The ultimate goal is to design prospective larger behavioral studies (SuRe first or R21) with a multi‐centered intervention with other RTRN institutions to demonstrate the applicability of this approach specifically focusing on the AA/POC community. The presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk for hospitalization and death in COVID‐19 patients. COVID‐19 patients with diabetes were found to be more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non‐invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (Zhang, et al., 2020). In light of these findings, the potential that existing racial and ethnic disparities will be worsened and compounded by COVID‐19 because African Americans continue to suffer a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, with more pronounced disparities in type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Health disparities among AAs has continued and have shown to be perpetuated by the COVID‐19 pandemic. California's death rate among African Americans is disproportionate as compared to representation in the population (10% mortality versus 6% population) and even more disproportionate in some counties. Specifically, the data from Los Angeles County showed a 14% mortality rate among African Americans, who make up 9% of the county's population (Azar, et al., 2020). In the context of circumstances surrounding COVID‐19, the California Health Care Foundation identifies this pandemic as ""a perfect storm of irrefutable evidence that people of color are caught in a web of social inequality."" (Hernández, 2020) DSME/S is a crucial element in helping patients navigate and incorporate successful care into their daily lives. It has been proven to: instill lifestyle modifications which are directly associated with improved blood sugar control, reduce risk of diabetes complications, fewer hospitalizations, lower diabetes related medical cost and to be cost‐effective. Some reports show that less than 38% of patients diagnosed with diabetes actually receive DSME/S (Torres, Tiwari, Movsas, Carrasquillo & Zonszein, 2015). The proposed study and intervention seek to consider and begin to mitigate these confounding issues. As the COVID‐19 pandemic appears to be ending among some populations, research suggests that AAs continue to be severely impacted. In communities that have higher percentages of AAs, study findings indicate an association between negative COVID‐19 health outcomes and AAs, including higher prevalence and higher death rates. In addition, the data suggests that the odds of surviving the epidemic may correlate to poverty levels, indicating that other at‐risk minority populations, affected by poverty, may also be disproportionately affected (Cyrus et al., 2020). Snowden and Graaf (2021) report that there are greater African American COVID‐induced challenges and suffering, and COVID‐19 threatens to perpetuate these differences. While it is understood that policies are fundamental to shifting the trajectory of the Diabetes epidemic and the COVID‐19 pandemic, we believe that COVID‐19 education enhanced DSME/S interventions are promising. Moreover, we believe that by incorporating community‐based outreach, testing, and access to culturally competent educational interventions within African American communities hold great promise for increased protection and prevention against COVID‐19 along with better T2DM outcomes. This will in turn have a positive impact on some of the observed disparities. This research project can provide the groundwork to further develop and implement DSME/S that is easily accessible and less limiting than traditional DSME/S programs for this population, especially during a critical inflection point in the COVID‐19 pandemic. Literature suggests digital technology is the next link to enhanced communication between providers and patients. Patients with diabetes often report a variety of barriers to accessing DSME/S, especially issues with transportation and time commitments in attending on‐site DSME/S programs. This online T2DM education program provides an alternative for those who are unable or unwilling to attend traditional DSME/S. While an online program does not replace the need for traditional DSME/S or certified diabetes educators, having online/on‐demand availability does provide an additional resource for providers to offer for educating patients with diabetes in self‐management and COVID‐19 prevention and protection education. The ""emPOWERed to Change"" program presents a unique, novel and timely approach to DSME/S with the enhancement of COVID‐19 education. The program leverages digital technology to better support patients. It will be delivered virtually, on‐demand, with culturally sensitive content and utilize mHealth and social media which has shown to be increasingly useful given the COVID‐19 pandemic while capitalizing on the current trends of preferred engagement via technology for this population. The ""emPOWERed to change program"" also integrates support through the use of Social media. This interaction provides an additional means for assisting patients with diabetes as it increases access to care, provides tools for self‐management, and fosters support from others diagnosed with the same disease (Kenny, 2014). According to Power and Pitfalls of Social Media in Diabetes Care, (McMahon, 2013) some individuals find extra value in interacting with their peers online, as they may feel their provider lacks the ability to relate to them in the way other patients with diabetes can. Providers report finding that when patients utilize social media for support, they have become increasingly compliant with treatment recommendations, and appear to sustain healthy lifestyle changes (Cooper & Kar, 2014). These lifestyle changes include healthy eating and engaging in physical activity more often when these individuals have the support of their peers, and these peers, in many cases, are available exclusively online (Cooper & Kar, 2014). Also, engagement of individuals with diabetes via social media has been shown to provide the foundation for patients modified treatment regimens (McMahon, 2013). While behavior modification plays an important role in controlling blood sugars, the use of technology can support self‐management techniques and behaviors helpful to patients self‐monitoring their blood glucose levels (Park, Burford, Nolan, & Hanlen, 2016). Preliminary data from The Suga Project Foundation's DSME/S program, led by Natalie Pauls, PI, has shown that the elements of the ""emPOWERed to Change"" program are effective at increasing knowledge about type 2 diabetes, helping avoid risks of complication, improved communication with healthcare providers and an overall increased sense of better well‐being through stress management and peer support. Literature reviews by Cotter, et al., (2014) and Gabarron, et al., (2018) suggests that technology‐enabled strategies provide a viable option for facilitating diabetes self‐management, however, future research is needed on the use of web‐based interventions in underserved communities, which is what this study will attempt to begin examining. Study Design We propose a randomized, controlled study design among 134 participants. Through a simple randomization methodology, half of participants will be randomized to an intervention program and usual care group. The proposed hypothesis, based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), is: African Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) in Los Angeles County with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who participate in the ""emPOWERed to Change"" program will demonstrate sustained glycemic control.

The focus of the current study was to evaluate factors associated with primary care providers' (PCPs') decision on whether to follow recommendations from the remote diabetes team in Upstate New York. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the intervention group, diabetes educators videoconferenced with patients monthly to download and review glucose and blood pressure readings, diabetes‐related issues, and laboratory data. These were reviewed with an endocrinologist, and recommendations to change therapy were sent to the PCPs. At annual visits, participants completed the Diabetes Symptom Checklist‐Type 2 symptom severity score and Impact of Telemedicine surveys. RESULTS: Factors that increase the acceptance rate of IDEATel recommendations included longer time in the study (p=0.0052), changing medication dose as opposed to starting or stopping a medication (p<0.0001), adjusting glucose‐lowering agents compared with antihypertensive or antilipid medications (p<0.0001), higher total Diabetes Symptom Checklist‐Type 2 symptom severity score (p=0.045), greater number of glucose readings submitted by participants (p=0.014), and high score on surveys measuring impact of telemedicine on patient's knowledge, adherence, and satisfaction (p=0.0023).

Inequities driven by structural racism and systemic oppression have led to racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment. Diabetes‐self management training (DSMT), remote glucose monitoring (RGM), and tailored support from a community health worker (CHW) have the potential to improve outcomes. This study will examine the implementation of these interventions in a safety‐net healthcare setting. Methods: Using implementation science and racial equity principles, this study aims to (1) evaluate the appropriateness; (2) measure fidelity; and (3) compare the effectiveness of varying the combination and sequence of three interventions. An exploratory aim will measure sustainability of intervention adherence and uptake. This mixed‐methods trial employs a sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, patient focus group discussions, and staff interviews. Eligible Black/Latine patients will be recruited using patient lists extracted from the electronic medical record system. After a detailed screening process, eligible patients will be invited to attend an in‐person enrollment appointment. Informed consent will be obtained and patients will be randomized to either DSMT or RGM. At 6 months, patients will complete two assessments (diabetes empowerment and diabetes‐related distress), and HbA1c values will be reviewed. “Responders” will be considered those who have an HbA1c that has improved by at least one percentage point. “Responders” remain in their first assigned study arm. “Nonresponders” will be randomized to either switch study arms or be paired with a CHW. At 6 months participants will complete two assessments again, and their HbA1c will be reviewed. Twelve patient focus groups, two for each intervention paths, will be conducted along with staff interviews. Discussion: This study is the first, to our knowledge, that seeks to fill critical gaps in our knowledge of optimal sequence and combinations of interventions to support diabetes management among Black and Latine patients receiving care at a safety‐net hospital. By achieving the study aims, we will build the evidence for optimizing equitable diabetes management and ultimately reducing racial and ethnic healthcare disparities for patients living in disinvested urban settings.

The use of advanced technological tools, including smartphone‐based platforms, to improve medical care and outcomes has been demonstrated in various fields of medicine, but only a few small studies were performed with gestational diabetes mellitus patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the impact of introducing a smartphone‐based daily feedback and communication platform between gestational diabetes mellitus patients and their physicians, on patient compliance, glycemic control, pregnancy outcome, and patient satisfaction. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, single‐center, randomized controlled trial. Newly diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus patients presenting to our multidisciplinary diabetes‐in‐pregnancy clinic were randomized to: (1) routine biweekly prenatal clinic care (control group); or (2) additional daily detailed feedback on their compliance and glycemic control from the clinic team via an application installed on their smartphone (smartphone group). The primary outcome was patient compliance defined as the actual blood glucose measurements/instructed measurements ×100. The secondary outcomes included diabetes‐control parameters, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes. The study was adequately powered to detect a 20% difference in patient compliance, based on a preliminary phase that demonstrated 70% baseline compliance to glucose measurements. RESULTS: A total of 120 newly diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus patients were analyzed. The 2 groups did not differ in terms of age, parity, education, body mass index, family history, maternal comorbidities, oral glucose tolerance test values, and hemoglobin A1C at randomization. The smartphone group demonstrated higher level of compliance (84 ± 0.16% vs 66 ± 0.28%, P < .001); lower mean blood glucose (105.1 ± 8.6 mg/dL vs 112.6 ± 7.4 mg/dL, P < .001); lower rates of off‐target measurements both fasting (4.7 ± 0.4% vs 8.4 ± 0.6%, P < .001) and 1‐hour postprandial (7.7 ± 0.8% vs 14.3 ± 0.8%, P < .001); and a lower rate of pregnancies requiring insulin treatment (13.3% vs 30.0%, P = .044). The rates of macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, shoulder dystocia, and other delivery and neonatal complications did not differ between the groups. Patients in the smartphone group reported excellent satisfaction from the use of the application and from their overall prenatal care.

Glycaemic control decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the pregnant individual and infant. Achieving glycaemic control can be challenging for Medicaid‐insured pregnant individuals who experience a high burden of unmet social needs. Multifaceted provider‐patient‐based approaches are needed to improve glycaemic control in this high‐risk pregnant population. Mobile health (mHealth) applications (app), provider dashboards, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and addressing social needs have been independently associated with improved glycaemic control in non‐pregnant individuals living with diabetes. The combined effect of these interventions on glycaemic control among pregnant individuals with T2D remains to be evaluated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a two‐arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the combined effects of a multicomponent provider‐patient intervention, including a patient mHealth app, provider dashboard, CGM, a community health worker to address non‐medical health‐related social needs and team‐based care versus the current standard of diabetes and prenatal care. We will recruit 124 Medicaid‐insured pregnant individuals living with T2D, who are ≤20 weeks of gestation with poor glycaemic control measured as a haemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5% assessed within 12 weeks of trial randomisation or within 12 weeks of enrolling in prenatal care from an integrated diabetes and prenatal care programme at a tertiary care academic health system located in the Midwestern USA. We will measure how many individuals achieve the primary outcome of glycaemic control measured as an A1c<6.5% by the time of delivery, and secondarily, adverse pregnancy outcomes; patient‐reported outcomes (eg, health and technology engagement, literacy and comprehension; provider‐patient communication; diabetes self‐efficacy; distress, knowledge and beliefs; social needs referrals and utilisation; medication adherence) and CGM measures of glycaemic control (in the intervention group).

DESIGN: In a German rehabilitation center, 249 patients with Type 2 diabetes were separated into randomized groups, either a 12‐month telephone follow‐up support group or the usual care group. The counselor identified personal target areas and intervention modules and developed with the patient an individualized action plan for the telephone support. To enhance motivational processes, they used motivational interviewing techniques. Counselors called patients monthly to support the implementation of the personal plans into the patients' daily routines and to screen for emotional problems. Assessments measured exercise, diet, medication adherence, psychological variables, body mass index, HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: Twelve months after inpatient rehabilitation, the telephone group's rate of physical activity rose by 26% compared with the usual care group's 10%. Patients in the intervention group exhibited greater improvements in terms of their illness burden, psychological well‐being, and depression. HbA1c fell in the telephone group but increased in the usual care group (‐0.68% vs. 0.12%). The intervention group's cardiovascular risk fell, whereas the usual care group's rose (‐0.57 vs. 0.23). CONCLUSION: A theory‐based telephone‐delivered follow‐up intervention utilizing motivational interviewing techniques and focusing on personalized action planning demonstrated improvements in patients' level of activity and health status 12‐months postrehabilitation discharge and may be a beneficial supplement to rehabilitation programs.

The role of technology has been gaining strong support as evidence builds of its potential to improve diabetes management; however, evaluation of its impact in minority populations is limited. This study intends to provide early evidence of a theory‐driven intervention, Tablet‐Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self‐management skills (TABLETS), using real‐time videoconferencing for education and skills training. We examine the potential for TABLETS to improve health risk behaviors and reduce CVD risk outcomes among a low‐income African American (AA) population with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study is a two‐arm, pilot controlled trial that randomizes 30 participants to the TABLETS intervention and 30 participants to a usual care group. Blinded outcome assessments will be completed at baseline, 2.5 months (immediate post‐intervention), and 6.5 months (follow‐up). The TABLETS intervention consists of culturally tailored telephone‐delivered diabetes education and skills training delivered via videoconferencing on tablet devices, with two booster sessions delivered via tablet‐based videoconferencing at 3 months and 5 months to stimulate ongoing use of the tablet device with access to intervention materials via videoconferencing slides and a manual of supplementary materials. The primary outcomes are physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self‐monitoring behavior, whereas the secondary outcomes are HbA1c, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), BP, CVD risk, and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a theory‐driven, tablet‐aided behavioral intervention that utilizes real‐time videoconferencing technology for education and skills training on self‐management behaviors and quality of life among a high‐risk, low‐income AA population with an uncontrolled dyad or triad of CVD risk factors (diabetes with or without hypertension or hyperlipidemia). The intervention leverages the use of novel technology for education and skill‐building to foster improved diabetes self‐management. The findings of this study will inform the process of disseminating the intervention to a broader and larger sample of people and can potentially be refined to align with clinical workflows that target a subsample of patients with poor diabetes self‐management.

No research has addressed the intensity or duration of telemonitoring required to sustain such improvements. PURPOSE: The DiaTel study (10 January 2005 to 1 November 2007) compared active care management (ACM) with home telemonitoring (n=73) to monthly care coordination (CC) telephone calls (n=77) among veterans with diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control. The purpose of the DiaTel Extension was to assess whether initial improvements could be sustained with interventions of the same or lower intensity among participants who re‐enrolled in a 6‐month extension of DiaTel. METHODS: DiaTel participants receiving ACM were re‐assigned randomly to monthly CC calls with continued telemonitoring but no active medication management (ACM‐to‐CCHT, n=23) or monthly CC telephone calls (ACM‐to‐CC, n=21). DiaTel participants receiving CC were re‐assigned randomly to continued CC (CC‐to‐CC, n=28) or usual care (UC, ie, CC‐to‐UC, n=29). Hemaglobin A1c (HbA1c) was assessed at 3 and 6 months following re‐randomization. RESULTS: Marked HbA1c improvements observed in DiaTel ACM participants were sustained 6 months after re‐randomization in both ACM‐to‐CCHT and ACM‐to‐CC groups. Lesser HbA1c improvements observed in DiaTel CC participants were sustained in both CC‐to‐CC and CC‐to‐UC groups. No benefit was apparent for continued transmission of glucose data among DiaTel ACM participants or continued monthly telephone calls among DiaTel CC participants 6 months after re‐randomization. CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in HbA1c achieved using home telemonitoring and active medication management for 6 months were sustained 6 months later with interventions of decreased intensity in VA Health System‐qualified veterans.

We conducted a study to determine whether automated telephone feedback to informal caregivers (""CarePartners"") increased engagement in m‐health support among diabetes and hypertension patients in Bolivia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with diabetes and/or hypertension were identified through ambulatory clinics affiliated with four hospitals. All patients enrolled with a CarePartner.

These problems are associated with the difficulty of these patients in managing their lifestyle, which may even lead to the abandonment of treatment. The present study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of a multipurpose activity control solution for home activity (home activity control system), which will provide information on the activities of daily living carried out outside in real time, to improve adherence to each of the therapeutic objectives agreed on with the diabetic patient. Patients and Methods: A pilot randomised controlled feasibility study will be carried out to evaluate a home activity control system (Beprevent) in managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be included (10 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group). Data on satisfaction with the tool will be collected from professionals and patients, as well as other clinical/epidemiological data from their digital health records and several questionnaires, at baseline and six months. In addition, data will also be recorded regarding the degree of adherence to the behaviors agreed on with the patients before starting the study to assess changes throughout the study and their relationship with clinical results (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol, etc), and to compare these outcomes between two study groups. Discussion: This project involves the incorporation of telemedicine in the management of patients with diabetes.

Failure to take medicine regularly to treat diabetes has been identified as a major problem. Resources to identify and support patients who are not making the best use of medicine in low‐ and middle‐income settings are scarce. Mobile phones are widely available in these settings, including among people with diabetes; linked technologies, such as short message service (SMS) text messaging, have shown promise in delivering low‐cost interventions efficiently. However, evidence showing that these interventions will work when carried out at a larger scale and measuring the extent to which they will improve health outcomes when added to usual care is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this trial is to test the effectiveness of sending brief, automated SMS text messages for improving health outcomes and medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to an active control. METHODS: We will carry out a randomized trial recruiting from clinics in two contrasting settings in sub‐Saharan Africa: Cape Town, South Africa, and Lilongwe, Malawi. Intervention messages will advise people about the benefits of their diabetes treatment and offer motivation and encouragement around lifestyle and use of medication. We allocated patients, using randomization with a minimization algorithm, to receive either three to four intervention messages per week or non‐health‐related messages every 6 weeks. We will follow up with participants for 12 months, measuring important risk factors for poor health outcomes and complications in diabetes. This will enable us to estimate potential health benefits, including the primary outcome of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels as a marker for long‐term blood glucose control and a secondary outcome of blood pressure control. We will record the costs of performing these activities and estimate cost‐effectiveness. We will also use process evaluation to capture the collection of medication and assess the reception of the intervention by participants and health care workers. RESULTS: Recruitment to the trial began in September 2016 and follow‐up of participants was completed in October 2018. Data collection from electronic health records and other routinely collected sources is continuing. The database lock is anticipated in June 2019, followed by analysis and disclosing of group allocation. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge gained from this study will have wide applications and advance the evidence base for effectiveness of mobile phone‐based, brief text messaging on clinical outcomes and in large‐scale, operational settings. It will provide evidence for cost‐effectiveness and acceptability that will further inform policy development and decision making. We will work with a wide network that includes patients, clinicians, academics, industry, and policy makers to help us identify opportunities for informing people about the work and raise awareness of what is being developed and studied.

However, patients do not always monitor their feet or seek medical attention when ulcers worsen. New approaches for diabetic‐foot surveillance are needed. The goal of this study was to determine if patients would be willing and able to regularly photograph their feet; evaluate different foot‐imaging approaches; and determine clinical adequacy of the resulting pictures. Methods: We recruited adults with diabetes and assigned them to Self Photo (SP), Assistive Device (AD), or Other Party (OP) groups. The SP group photographed their own feet, while the AD group used a selfie stick; the OP group required another adult to photograph the patient's foot. For 8 weeks, we texted all patients requesting that they text us a photo of each foot. The collected images were evaluated for clinical adequacy. Numbers of (i) submitted and (ii) clinically useful images were compared among groups using generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models.

The development of new medical treatments is promising and important, but the basic treatment remains self‐management, even if adherence to lifestyle advice is low. Electronic health (eHealth) or mHealth interventions can increase empowerment among people living with T2D and may compensate for the lack of professional resources and geographical distances. The interactive self‐management support (iSMS) project aims at including digital tools to support people living with T2D in their self‐management and facilitating their interaction with diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs). This protocol outlines a study with the purpose of developing and evaluating an intervention where people living with T2D can increase self‐efficacy and empowerment through digital self‐monitoring and interaction with DSNs. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a person‐centered iSMS intervention in primary health care for people with T2D in addition to their usual diabetes care. METHODS: This study is a 12‐month, 3‐armed, nonblinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), which will be conducted in 6 primary health care centers (HCCs) in northern Sweden. Eligible participants will be randomized to either an intervention group (n=46), a control group (n=46), or an external group (n=46) for comparison. The intervention group will receive the mobile app, and the control group will receive a minimal intervention (diabetes brochure) and the usual standard of care. Changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: This trial is currently open for recruitment. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in Autumn 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This study, with its focus on iSMS, will provide insights regarding suitable ways to promote and develop a person‐centered intervention. If successful, the intervention has the potential to become a model for the provision of self‐management support to people with T2D.

The program included group and individual education, diabetes self‐recording and monitoring through the DiaNote app, phone visit consultations conducted by trained registered nurse (RN) researchers, and notification services. Education The educational component of the program was based on the ADCES7 Self‐Care Behaviors framework established by the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists (ADCES). The DSI program is structured around four of the seven ADCES domains of diabetes education—diet, medication, exercise, and blood sugar management. These training sessions, led by an RN research assistant, typically lasted approximately 15–20 minutes each. Recording and Monitoring Using the DiaNote App The DiaNote group was required to log into the DiaNote app multiple times a day and utilize it for recording and monitoring various aspects, including diet, duration of exercise, adherence to medication, and blood glucose levels. DiaNote users could monitor, review, and analyze these records via an analysis page. Phone Visit Consultation Individualized phone visits were conducted to enhance social motivation for self‐management and to offer professional support. The phone calls were conducted by a trained RN research assistant five times per participant over 12 weeks, once after the first week, and subsequently once every two weeks. The content of these calls was a refresher for DiaNote app usage and changes in diabetic self‐behaviors. There was also an opportunity for a question‐and‐answer session regarding difficulties in using the app. Each phone visit lasted 4–5 minutes.

Innovative approaches such as clinical decision support (CDS) software could play a major role in improving the quality of hypertension/diabetes care in primary care settings. OBJECTIVE: To describe the steps and processes in the development of mWellcare, a complex intervention based on mobile health (mHealth) technology. METHODS: The Medical Research Council framework was used to develop mWellcare in four steps: (1) identify gaps in usual care through literature review and health facility assessments; (2) identify the components of the intervention through discussions and consultations with experts; (3) develop intervention (clinical algorithms and mHealth system); and (4) evaluate acceptability and feasibility through pilot testing in five community health centers. RESULTS: Lack of evidence‐based, integrated, and systematic management of chronic conditions were major gaps identified. Experts in information technology, clinical fields, and public health professionals identified intervention components to address these gaps. Thereafter, clinical algorithm contextualized to primary care settings were prepared and the mWellcare intervention was developed. During the 2‐month pilot, 631 patients diagnosed with hypertension and/or diabetes were registered, with a follow‐up rate of 36.2%. The major barrier was resistance to follow mWellcare recommended patient workflow, and to overcome it, we emphasized onsite training and orientation program to cover all health care team member in each CHC. CONCLUSION: A pilot‐tested mWellcare intervention is an mHealth system with important components, i.e. integrated management of chronic conditions, evidence‐based CDS, longitudinal health data and automated short‐messaging service to reinforce compliance to drug intake and follow‐up visit, which will be used by nurses at primary health care settings in India.

Decision support tools can help clinicians with the inspection of monitoring data, providing a preliminary analysis to ease their interpretation and reduce the evaluation time per patient. This paper presents Sinedie, a clinical decision support system designed to manage the treatment of patients with gestational diabetes. Sinedie aims to improve access to specialized healthcare assistance, to prevent patients from unnecessary displacements, to reduce the evaluation time per patient and to avoid gestational diabetes adverse outcomes. Methods A web‐based telemedicine platform was designed to remotely evaluate patients allowing them to upload their glycaemia data at home directly from their glucose meter, as well as report other monitoring variables like ketonuria and compliance to dietary treatment. Glycaemia values, not tagged by patients, are automatically labelled with their associated meal by a classifier based on the Expectation Maximization clustering algorithm and a C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm. Two finite automata are combined to determine the patient's metabolic condition, which is analysed by a rule‐based knowledge base to generate therapy adjustment recommendations. Diet recommendations are automatically prescribed and notified to the patients, whereas recommendations about insulin requirements are notified also to the physicians, who will decide if insulin needs to be prescribed. The system provides clinicians with a view where patients are prioritized according to their metabolic condition. A randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Sinedie interventions versus standard care and its impact in the professionals’ workload in terms of the clinician's time required per patient; number of face‐to‐face visits; frequency and duration of telematics reviews; patients’ compliance to self‐monitoring; and patients’ satisfaction. Results Sinedie was clinically evaluated at “Parc Tauli University Hospital” in Spain during 17 months with the participation of 90 patients with gestational diabetes. Sinedie detected all situations that required a therapy adjustment and all the generated recommendations were safe. The time devoted by clinicians to patients’ evaluation was reduced by 27.389% and face‐to‐face visits per patient were reduced by 88.556%. Patients reported to be highly satisfied with the system, considering it useful and trusting in being well controlled. There was no monitoring loss and, in average, patients measured their glycaemia 3.890 times per day and sent their monitoring data every 3.477 days. Conclusions Sinedie generates safe advice about therapy adjustments, reduces the clinicians’ workload and helps physicians to identify which patients need a more urgent or more exhaustive examination and those who present good metabolic control. Additionally, Sinedie saves patients unnecessary displacements which contributes to medical centres’ waiting list reduction",102,,35‐49,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 28495347,EMBASE 614842506,,,,Journal article,"*clinical decision support system; *diet therapy; *pregnancy diabetes mellitus /drug therapy /drug therapy /therapy; *smart and educational system for pregnancy diabetes mellitus; Adverse outcome; Article; Clinical article; Controlled study; Decision Support Systems, Clinical [*statistics & numerical data]; Decision tree; Diabetes, Gestational [*diet therapy, *drug therapy]; Diet; Female; Glucose blood level; Human; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents [*administration & dosage]; Insulin [*administration & dosage]; Insulin treatment; Internet [*statistics & numerical data]; Ketonuria; Learning algorithm; Patient Satisfaction; Patient monitoring; Patient satisfaction; Pregnancy; Prescription; Priority journal; Randomized controlled trial; Self monitoring; Spain; Telemedicine; Treatment planning; Workload",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.02.014,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01335664/full,Pregnancy and Childbirth,humans,clinical trial,True,False

Although numerous recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of either TM or HC in improving diabetes and other chronic disease self‐care behaviors, and to the knowledge of the investigators no information is available regarding comparative effectiveness of these modalities in urban and rural subgroups. Prevalence of diabetes, related comorbidities, poverty, obesity, food insecurity, and tobacco use is higher in rural areas as compared with urban. Moreover, rural areas struggle to address these needs because of lower access to transportation, primary care, specialty care, diabetes education, and mental health resources. However, urban living has its own unique set of problems—including increased stress and fear for one's physical safety—that may impact the comparative effectiveness of HC and TM. Although there are HC studies that show effectiveness in interventions either in rural or urban areas, there are no HC studies of which the investigators are aware that specifically examine the differences in U.S. rural and urban participants in regards to engagement rates and clinical outcomes from a health coaching intervention. Similarly, telemedicine and mobile health approaches have been particularly advocated for rural populations yet little evidence supports their comparative benefit. The lack of comparative effectiveness of text messaging and health coaching for diabetes self‐care in vulnerable urban and rural subgroups represents a critical gap in research that the study is designed to directly address. The study will compare both strategies with enhanced usual care (EC) with diabetes educational materials. Study Aims: As a result, this research will use a pragmatic randomized trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of patient‐driven TM versus HC versus EC for African‐American adults with uncontrolled diabetes and multiple chronic conditions in MUA with an emphasis on identifying and quantifying important interactions between key baseline characteristics and treatment arm. Specific aims include: Aim 1‐Quantify the effectiveness of TM, HC, and EC in improving the primary outcome measures (diabetes self‐care activities related to general diet, exercise and medication adherence); Aim 2‐Determine the contributions of six key, baseline patient characteristics: 1) urban vs. rural residence, 2) health literacy, 3) medical complexity, 4) social complexity, 5) smart vs. cell phone ownership, and 6) age, to the comparative effectiveness of TM, HC, and EC; and Aim 3‐Quantify the effectiveness of TM, HC, and EC in improving secondary outcomes of average blood sugar, quality of life, and primary care engagement. The long‐term objectives are to disseminate and foster implementation of the results of this research in MUA nationwide to improve critical self‐care supports in primary care for our most vulnerable populations. Overall study design: Pragmatic randomized clinical trial. Main components of the intervention and comparator(s): The study will test two critical strategies for patient engagement that may lead to substantive improvements in the quality of care and outcomes most important to vulnerable patients with diabetes: 1) patient‐driven TM, and 2) patient‐driven HC. The two parallel primary care‐based and patient‐driven study interventions (i.e. TM and HC) have been designed to provide approximately the same content, but with two alternative delivery mechanisms. TM will incorporate supportive cognitive behavioral strategies to encourage improved diabetes self‐care decisions and will be tailored based on participant demographics, health literacy, preferences, treatment self‐regulation, perceived competency and reported barriers to self‐care. Motivational interviewing focused HC will aim to meet with participants for individual HC sessions bi‐monthly the first 2 months (Intensive Phase‐4 sessions following randomization) followed by monthly for remaining 8 months (12 sessions total) to provide support regarding diet/weight loss, physical activity, and medication adherence tailored according to patient‐identified health goals. Both strategies will be compared with EC with diabetes educational materials. Study population: For the main comparative effectiveness analysis (Aim 1) the total sample size (after dropouts) is N=800 with 40% randomized to the TM arm (N1=320), 40% to the HC arm (N2=320), and 20% to the EC arm (N3 = 160). Participants include African‐American adults, ages 35‐75, with uncontrolled diabetes and multiple chronic conditions, living in medically underserved communities in the MidSouth who have a cell phone or smart phone with texting capability and complete a two‐week run‐in period demonstrating responsiveness to TM. Primary/secondary outcomes: The primary outcome measures assessing effectiveness include: three (out of six total) subscales of the revised Summary of Diabetes Self‐Care Activities questionnaire assessing general diet, exercise, and medication adherence. Secondary outcomes include: diabetes‐specific quality of life using the Diabetes‐39, primary care engagement using National Health Interview Survey questions regarding delayed needed care, and average blood sugar (A1c) obtained from medical records and reported in the DWPC‐R. Analytic methods: For Aim 1, in the context of repeated measures ANOVA, using t‐tests within arm to detect change from baseline to 12‐months (Follow‐up 3), power exceeds 0.9 for all primary outcomes. For Aim 2, six analyses will assess heterogeneity of treatment effects by evaluating the interaction of each key, dichotomized, baseline characteristic with treatment arm, estimating means and standard errors of six subclasses, and within each characteristic (e.g. low or high health literacy) testing for differences between TM and HC, TM and EC, and HC and TM.

432,432,CN-01561397,"NCT03026426,",Effectiveness of a mHealth Intervention for the Treatment of Depression in People With Diabetes or Hypertension in Peru,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03026426,2017,"Epidemiologic research has clearly established the significant public health importance of mental disorders in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC). Among mental disorders, depression has become a major problem as a single condition and, more often, as part of complex clinical settings in which multiple conditions and risk factors are combined. There is substantial co‐morbidity between depression and chronic physical conditions, and the outcome of both conditions is impaired when there is this co‐morbidity. Most of the disease burden in Latin America is attributable to chronic diseases such as cardio‐vascular diseases as hypertension and diabetes, as well as to mental disorders such as depression. Despite the public health impact of depression, it often goes unrecognized and untreated. One important factor for this treatment gap are the limited financial and human resources. The mental health resources available in LMIC are often not optimally distributed either. Funds and trained personnel are typically allocated to tertiary health care services, such as psychiatric hospitals. Therefore, any short‐ and medium‐term efforts to develop, evaluate, and disseminate effective mental health interventions in LMIC must adapt to these severe workforce shortages, resource limitations, and budgetary inequities. The mental health field needs to consider developing self‐help automated interventions that can reach people where there is insufficient access to specialized health care providers. This can be partially addressed applying two strategies: 1) increasing effective self‐management; and 2) task‐shifting roles to less specialized but appropriately trained health workers. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial with individuals with chronic diseases, i.e. hypertension and/or diabetes, and symptoms of depression in primary health centers and hospitals in Lima, Peru. Participants will be randomly assigned to the control arm or the intervention arm. The later will receive the CONEMO intervention, monitored by nurses. The focus of this project is on using a self‐help intervention that provides advice, support, and motivation. However, studies suggest that depressed patients left alone with the devices fail to make good use of self‐help interventions. Therefore, nurses will monitor participants by a web‐based dashboard connected to the smartphone application (CONEMO), motivate to continue using CONEMO if participants are non‐adherent and give technical support. Nurses will take part in supervision meetings at least once a week. Method: CONEMO is a randomized controlled trial conducted with 432 chronic patients who present diabetes and/or hypertension and depressive symptoms recruited in primary health care centers and public hospitals in Lima, Peru. Half of these participants will be randomized to receive the CONEMO intervention and the other half will receive enhanced usual care. The randomization will be made based on 2 strata: the health center/hospital the participant comes from and his/her PHQ9 score at screening (≤14; ≥15). The intervention, based on behavior activation, is delivered by a smartphone and monitored by nurses who mediate this intervention, motivating and supporting the participant and monitoring his/her performance. The CONEMO intervention is delivered 3 times a week for a period of 6 weeks, summing up to a total of 18 sessions. Intensity of depressive symptoms is assessed by research assistants using the PHQ‐9 at baseline, 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐up assessments. Outcomes: The primary outcome in this study is the proportion of participants with a reduction of 50% or more in the PHQ‐9 score at the 3‐month assessment. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of participants with a reduction of 50% or more in the PHQ‐9 score at the 6‐month assessment, and the improvement in quality of life, adherence to diabetes, level of activity and hypertension medication and social functioning. There will also be a cost‐effectiveness evaluation using a intention to treat analysis, and a process evaluation. For the process evaluation, data will be collected from questionnaires about the CONEMO system, filled out by with participants at 3 months after inclusion, and interviews with the nurses at the end of the intervention.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT03026426,,,Trial registry record,Depression; Depressive Disorder; Diabetes Mellitus; Hypertension,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01561397/full,Hypertension,humans,clinical trial,True,False

The Cambodian nongovernmental organization, MoPoTsyo, trains local residents with diabetes to be peer educators (PEs) to deliver chronic disease self‐management training and medications to 14,000 people with hypertension and/or diabetes in Cambodia. We collaborated with MoPoTsyo to develop a mobile‐based messaging intervention (mobile health; mHealth) to link MoPoTsyo's database, PEs, pharmacies, clinics, and people living with diabetes and/or hypertension to improve adherence to evidence‐based treatment guidelines. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the facilitators and barriers to chronic disease management and the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of mHealth to support chronic disease management and strengthen community‐clinical linkages to existing services. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using semistructured interviews and focus groups with PEs and people living with diabetes and/or hypertension. Interviews were recorded and conducted in Khmer script, transcribed and translated into the English language, and uploaded into Atlas.ti for analysis. We used a thematic analysis to identify key facilitators and barriers to disease management and opportunities for mHealth content and format. The information‐motivation‐behavioral model was used to guide data collection, analysis, and message development. RESULTS: We conducted six focus groups (N=59) and 11 interviews in one urban municipality and five rural operating districts from three provinces in October 2016. PE network participants desired mHealth to address barriers to chronic disease management through reminders about medications, laboratory tests and doctor's consultations, education on how to incorporate self‐management into their daily lives, and support for obstacles to disease management. Participants preferred mobile‐based voice messages to arrive at dinnertime for improved phone access and family support. They desired voice messages over texts to communicate trust and increase accessibility for persons with limited literacy, vision, and smartphone access. PEs shared similar views and perceived mHealth as acceptable and feasible for supporting their work. We developed 34 educational, supportive, and reminder mHealth messages based on these findings. CONCLUSIONS: These mHealth messages are currently being tested in a cluster randomized controlled trial (#1R21TW010160) to improve diabetes and hypertension control in Cambodia. This study has implications for practice and policies in Cambodia and other LMICs and low‐resource US settings that are working to engage PEs and build community‐clinical linkages to facilitate chronic disease management.",8,4,e13536,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 32329737,EMBASE 631625930,,,,Journal article,"*Cambodia; *chronic disease; *developing country; *diabetic patient; *health educator; *hypertension; *non communicable disease; *qualitative research; *self care; Adult; Article; Cambodia [epidemiology]; Chronic Disease; Consultation; Controlled study; Diabetes Mellitus [epidemiology, therapy]; Education; English (language); Feasibility study; Female; Genetic transcription; Human; Humans; Hypertension [epidemiology, therapy]; Laboratory test; Literacy; Major clinical study; Male; Middle Aged; Middle income country; Motivation; Psychological model; Randomized controlled trial; Self‐Management; Semi structured interview; Smartphone; Telemedicine; Thematic analysis; Trust; Vision; Voice",10.2196/13536,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02123211/full,,humans,observational study,True,False

Study objectives: The study objective is to compare closed‐loop glucose control with standard insulin therapy with CGM in young people and adults with CF related diabetes in terms of: 1. EFFICACY: ‐ GLYCAEMIC CONTROL: The objective is to assess the efficacy of closed‐loop in maintaining CGM glucose levels within the target range from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l, as compared to standard insulin therapy combined with CGM (primary endpoint) and other measures of glucose control. ‐ LUNG FUNCTION: frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). ‐ METABOLIC: body mass index (BMI) and endogenous insulin secretion (C‐peptide). ‐ HEALTH‐RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE: CF‐specific and generic measures and interviews to assess psychosocial aspects and responses of participants to the technology. 2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of closed‐loop glucose control in terms of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and other adverse events and adverse device effects. 3. ACCEPTABILITY: The objective is to determine the duration of use of CGM and closed‐loop, and usability and acceptance of the closed‐loop system. 4. HEALTH ECONOMIC: The objective is to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of closed‐loop in the patient population compared with current standard care from the perspective of the NHS and social services. Participating clinical centres: Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, UK Kings College Hospital, London, UK Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK Sample Size: 114 young people (≥16 years) and adults completing the study. Up to 128 participants will be recruited to allow for dropouts. Maximum duration of study for a subject: 28 weeks (7 months) Recruitment: Participants will be recruited through outpatient CF or diabetes clinics or other established methods at participating centres. Consent: Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent. Baseline Assessment: Eligible participants will undergo a baseline evaluation involving taking a medical history including demographics, CF characteristics, genotype and current therapies, height/weight, spirometry (FEV1) and blood samples including HbA1c, C‐peptide and glucose. Urine pregnancy test will be done in females of child‐bearing age. Validated questionnaires will be completed and a masked glucose sensor applied. Run‐in Period: During the 2‐3 week run‐in period, participants will use their own insulin therapy and wear a masked CGM system. At the end of the run‐in period, for compliance, at least 10 days of CGM data needs to be recorded. CGM data during the run‐in period will be used to assess baseline glucose control before the start of the intervention phase. Only those with time in target glucose range <80% during this period will proceed to randomisation. Randomisation: Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio using central randomisation software to the use of closed‐loop or to standard therapy with CGM for 26 weeks. Randomisation will be stratified by site, age and baseline time in target glucose range. Automated closed loop insulin delivery (intervention arm): Training on the use of closed‐loop will be provided by the research team during a 1 to 2 hour session in an outpatient setting (clinical research facility) or may be done remotely. Competency on the use of study insulin pump, study CGM and closed‐loop system will be evaluated using a competency assessment tool developed by the research team. Further training may be delivered as required. Participants will be advised to use the closed‐loop system for the next 26 weeks at home. Conventional insulin therapy with CGM (control arm): Participants will use their own insulin therapy (injections or pump) and study CGM. Training on the use of real‐time CGM and how to interpret real‐time will be provided. Participants will use standard insulin therapy and real‐time CGM for the next 26 weeks at home. 3 month study visit: The following measurements will be taken: weight, spirometry (FEV1) and blood samples including HbA1c, C‐peptide and glucose. Data from the closed‐loop system and CGM system will be reviewed. Validated questionnaires will be completed. End of study assessments: The following measurements will be taken: weight, spirometry (FEV1) and blood samples including HbA1c, C‐peptide and glucose. Data from the closed‐loop system and CGM system will be reviewed. Validated questionnaires will be completed and a subset of participants will participate in interviews. Study devices will be returned and participants will resume usual care. Procedures for safety monitoring during trial: Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events and adverse device events will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia. A data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated adverse device/method effects that occur during the study and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals. Criteria for withdrawal of subjects on safety grounds: A participant may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. The following pre‐randomisation withdrawal criteria will apply: ‐ Participant time in range of >80% over the baseline masked CGM period ‐ Participant unable to demonstrate safe use of CGM as judged by the investigator An investigator can stop the participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible pre‐ and post‐randomisation withdrawal criteria include: ‐ Participant is unable to demonstrate safe use of study CGM and/or insulin pump as judged by the investigator ‐ Significant protocol violation or non‐compliance ‐ Recurrent severe hypoglycaemia events related to use of the closed‐loop system ‐ Recurrent severe persistent hyperglycaemia unrelated to infusion site failure and related to use of the closed‐loop system ‐ Decision by the investigator or sponsor that termination is in the subject's best medical interest ‐ Allergic reaction to insulin ‐ Severe allergic reaction to adhesive surface of infusion set or glucose sensor ‐ Serious adverse events ‐ Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding ‐ Technical grounds (e.g. participant relocates)",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05562492,,,Trial registry record,Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes Mellitus; Fibrosis; Insulin,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02467219/full,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,humans,clinical trial,True,False

SMS strategies for DM have not been tested among PEH despite the accessibility of mobile phones. We propose an SMS strategy could offer better communication, education, and information management; improve outreach; facilitate care coordination; explore barriers to care; and support behavior changes. Methods and analysis: This mixed‐methods (RCT and qualitative) study will be implemented in shelter‐clinics in New York City in collaboration with community organizations, allowing for sustainability and scalability. Aim 1 will evaluate the efficacy of a 6‐month SMS program for DM management versus an attention control on changes in HbA1c and adherence to DM self‐care activities, medications, and appointments at 9 months in adult PEH with uncontrolled DM (n = 100). Outcomes will be measured at 0, 3, 6, &9 months. AIM 2 will assess patients' and providers' attitudes, acceptability, and experience of the program through semi‐structured interviews with PEH (n = 20) and providers (n = 10). Discussion: DM is not well‐addressed among PEH. SMS strategies for DM have never been tested in PEH despite evidence of their effectiveness and access to mobile phones among PEH. Results from this study will provide important empirical data to inform evidence‐based strategies to avert personal suffering and significant costs. It will have broader policy implications in control of DM and other chronic diseases.",128,,107149,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 36918092,EMBASE 2023328452,,,,Journal article,*Cell Phone; *Diabetes Mellitus [therapy]; *Ill‐Housed Persons; *Text Messaging; *diabetes mellitus; *health disparity; *homelessness; *text messaging; Adult; Article; Attention; Chronic Disease; Chronic disease; Clinical trial; Community; Comparative effectiveness; Controlled study; Drug efficacy; Female; Human; Humans; Major clinical study; Male; Mobile phone; New York; Outcome assessment; Randomized controlled trial; Self care; Semi structured interview,10.1016/j.cct.2023.107149,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02570750/full,,humans,clinical trial,True,False

A standard medical care group and an intervention group that uses the MLink application and recommends online medical care. The standard care group In the standard care group, gestational diabetes management is conducted in accordance with the Obstetric Guidelines 2020. The standard treatment group provides treatment including insulin therapy through diet and exercise therapy and referral to a diabetologist as necessary. However, the medical treatment system should be face to face only, and in principle, one of the following is recommended for the frequency of blood glucose monitoring. 1. 6 times per day before each meal or 2 hours after each meal 2. 4 times per day before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal The intervention group In the intervention group, study subjects are to use the MLink downloaded to their smartphones from the day of enrollment until 14 days after the day of enrollment during the intervention period. Medical care providers distribute medical information and laboratory data forms with QR codes that can be issued from obstetric charts at each visit, and study subjects store the medical information by reading it with the MLink app. In addition, home information such as diet, blood glucose, insulin dosage, blood pressure, weight, and step count will also be recorded in the MLink. If the research participant wishes, and if the physician determines that there is no medical problem, he or she can receive medical care or nutritional guidance from a diabetes physician via online medical care.

Employing low‐cost innovative eHealth interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth), may help improve NCDs prevention and control among disadvantaged populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of employing low‐cost mHealth tools on the accessibility to health services and improvement of health indicators of individuals with NCDs in rural areas and refugee camps in Lebanon. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial study in which centers were allocated randomly into control and intervention sites. The effect of an employed mHealth intervention is assessed through selected quality indicators examined in both control and intervention groups. Sixteen primary health care centers (eight controls, eight interventions) located in rural areas and Palestinian refugee camps across Lebanon were included in this study. Data on diabetic and hypertensive patients‐1433 in the intervention group and 926 in the control group‐was extracted from patient files in the pre and postintervention periods. The intervention entailed weekly short message service messages, including medical information, importance of compliance, and reminders of appointments or regular physician follow‐up. Internationally established care indicators were utilized in this study. Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of participants, bivariate analysis, logistic and linear regression were conducted using SPSS (IBM Corp). RESULTS: Bivariate analysis of quality indicators indicated that the intervention group had a significant increase in blood pressure control (P=.03), as well as a significant decrease in the mean systolic blood pressure (P=.02), mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; P<.01), and in the proportion of HbA1c poor control (P=.02). Separate regression models controlling for age, gender, and setting showed a 28% increase in the odds of blood pressure control (P=.05) and a 38% decrease in the odds of HbA1c poor control (P=.04) among the intervention group in the posttest period. Females were at lower odds of HbA1c poor control (P=.01), and age was statistically associated with annual HbA1c testing (P<.01). Regression models for mean systolic blood pressure, mean diastolic blood pressure, and mean HbA1c showed that a mean decrease in HbA1c of 0.87% (P<.01) pretest to posttest period was observed among the intervention group. Patients in rural areas belonging to the intervention group had a lower HbA1c score as compared with those in refugee camps (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the importance of employing integrative approaches of diseases prevention and control in which existing NCD programs in underserved communities (ie, rural and refugee camps settings) are coupled with innovative, low‐cost approaches such as mHealth to provide an effective and amplified effect of traditional NCD‐targeted care that can be reflected by improved NCD‐related health indicators among the population.
